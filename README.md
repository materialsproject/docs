# Materials Project Documentation

This repository holds an archive of an older version of the Materials Project documentation, generated 
using the mkdocs system. The Materials Project has since transitioned to a new documentation system 
using GitBook. Please read the current documentation here: [https://docs.materialsproject.org](https://docs.materialsproject.org).

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this version of the documentation!
