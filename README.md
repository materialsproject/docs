Migration of content from our wiki
([https://www.materialsproject.org/wiki](https://www.materialsproject.org/wiki)) is underway. Until this notice is

- Foundations: concepts in materials and computer science that structure and
  aid interpretation of our data sets
- Case Studies: Examples of materials analysis and design using our
  data and tools
- Productivity: Using our website, application programming interface (API),
  and codebases.
- Reproducibility: How we generate and validate our computed data sets
- Contribution: Developer guides and design specifications

If you notice an error or omission, please post an [issue](https://github.com/materialsproject/docs/issues/new) or suggest an
edit to us via a Pull Request.

Thanks,
Materials Project Team

# Contributing

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator for project documentation. We also use the
[mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for styling.
