Info Confused about materials being \"deprecated\"? More info here . Current Database versions \u00b6 V2019.05 \u00b6 Introduced a new deprecated field to materials. By default the website and API only search for materials that are not deprecated: {\"deprecated\": false}. Deprecated 15,000 and added 3,600 new materials. We will be recomputing the deprecated materials to fill these spaces back up. Some of these new relaxations may end up matching current materials, so the total number of materials is not guaranteed to be the same as in V2019.02. Fixed an issue with sandboxes not properly building the whole hull. Previously, only the sandboxed chemical systems were being recalculated for energy_above_hull searches V2019.02 \u00b6 Added over 47,000 new materials from orderings of disordered ICSD as well as compounds from the Pauling File Finalized enforcing symmetry on piezo tensors Moved third order elastic data to elasticity_third_order so that people are not swamped by the mountain of information associated with it. V2018.12 \u00b6 Adjusted the mp-id naming scheme to fix \u201cmvc\u201d ids taking over old mp-ids. Fixed piezoeletric max_direction to be a miller index rather than a unit vector. Version 2018.11, Release Date: 2018-11-01 \u00b6 We've released a new revision of the Materials Project database as part of major overhaul of our software infrastructure to enable us to continue to build new properties and deliver them to you, the material science community, at an accelerating pace. This has also caused some growing pains as we fix bugs we created in building our new infrastructure from scratch. Many of our users have reported bugs and we are very grateful for that. We're making great strides in being as transparent as possible so everyone knows what is changing. As part of this we've settled on a monthly release schedule including an announcement that informs everyone on what has or has not changed. To kick this process off we have our current changes for the MP Database Release V2018.11. This will be updated on a monthly basis with what has changed. V2018.11 Changed the grouping of magnetic materials to aggregate all magnetic orderings of a given material into a single material-id, and report the lowest energy ordering Fixed incorrect calculation and display of polycrystalline dielectric constants Fixed labeling of all materials as high-pressure. Note we're parsing ICSD tags for this labeling so while some materials may not conventionally be considerd high-pressure, a single matching ICSD entry can tag a material as such. We would love to hear comments on how we could better tag high-pressure materials 5,849 new material ids. 3,556 retiring/re-aggregated material ids Version 2.0.0, Release Date: 04/13/2016 \u00b6 Equivalent to old version \"2014.04.18\" Use major.minor.patch versioning, inspired by semantic versioning , but for data. Arbitrarily choose \"2\" as the initial major version. When new data is added (typically nightly), db version remains the same When new kinds of data are added, bump the patch (x.y.Z) version When data organization (schema) changes, bump the minor (x.Y.z) version When calculation methodology changes, bump the major (X.y.z) version Old databases \u00b6 Data from the earlier 'Materials Genome' web site, served prior to 10/10/2011, is no longer supported.

However, sometimes experimental data refers to high-pressure phases. While the ICSD web site tags high-pressure phases, we could not technically retrieved this data. To detect high-pressure phase, we had instead to rely on an imperfect word detection in the journal title of the entry. Any entry with a journal title containing G[Pp]a, [kM]bar or [Pp]ressure will be considered as likely high-pressure phase and will be tagged with a warning accordingly. Unusual oxidation state detection manual \u00b6 Unusual oxidation states (e.g., +2 for Al) can be the indication of a problem with the experiment or lead to large errors in computations (e.g., when an oxidation state requires electrons in the core of the pseudopotential to participate in bonding). To tag the entries with less common oxidation states and warn the user about them, we performed statistics on all the unique entries in the ICSD. From this statistical analysis, we estimated the probability p(n|A) where n is an oxidation state and A is an element. For instance, we p(+2|Al) will be very low, as it is very rare to observe Al in a +2 state. We decided to tag any entry with oxidation states according to the ICSD with a probability lower than 10%. Please note that this affect only compounds with assigned oxidation states in the ICSD. Volume Change Error manual \u00b6 We have used the difference between the computed volume after DFT relaxation and the volume reported experimentally as an indicator of a problem with a computation or entry. The problem can come from the experimental side (for instance atomic positions wrongly assigned in the ICSD) or from the approximation used in DFT. Our analysis focused only on GGA (without U) results. Our strategy consist in first establishing a volume change distribution from our large data set. After establishing this distribution, outliers will be easily identified and tagged with a warning. Volume Change Distribution in GGA \u00b6 Our analysis focused on the GGA data in the database available on Friday September 23, 2011. In total, we considered 11579 entries. We report on volume changes by computing: $$ \\Delta V=\\frac{V*{GGA}-V*{exp}}{V*{exp}} $$ Where $$ V*{GGA} $$ is the unit cell volume obtained by GGA and $$ V_{exp} $$ the experimental volume given by the ICSD The issue with high pressure phases \u00b6 If the data is right away used, we would observe a longer tail on the positive values. This data is from the high pressure phase. Indeed, while our computations have been performed at 0 atm, compounds characterized at high-pressure will show a lower experimental than computed volume. This is not per se an error but instead a discrepancy between the experimental and computational conditions. To mitigate, this issue we removed from this analysis any entry likely to refer to a high-pressure phase according to the methodology presented in [^1] The fitting of the distribution \u00b6 After exclusion of the possible high-pressure phases, we have 10768 points available to study the difference between experimental and computed volume. Figure 1 shows the histogram of volume difference. The distribution is symmetric but its median is positive (3.2%) indicating a tendency for GGA to overestimate the volume. This is in agreement with the know-how in the field established from previous studies on smaller set of compounds. We obtained a very good fit to the data by using the a t-location scale distribution.[^2] A normal distribution could not be fitted to this data because of the heavy tail observed. Using matlab and a maximum likelihood approach, we obtained maximum likelihood estimates as well as confidence intervals for the three parameters of the distribution. Figure 2 shows the good agreement between the raw data and the t-location scale probability density distribution. The tagging of the entries \u00b6 After fitting the distribution, it is possible to tag the entries outlying the distribution. We assigned a warning tag to any entry in our database with a volume error higher than the 95th percentile (situated at 9.6% volume change) and lower than the 5th percentile (situated at -3,2% volume change). Figure 3 shows these boundaries on the cumulative t-location scale distribution. In total, 959 entries have been assigned a warning. Some examples of outliers detected by the volume difference \u00b6 Here, we analyze some of the largest outliers found in our analysis. Through these examples, we illustrate what kind of errors can be observed. YZn and YbZn \u00b6 Both compounds (task_id: 11577 and 179, icsd_id: 106232, 206226) show enormous volume differences: 370% and 350% ! Looking at the data present in the ICSD, we found that the paper reference mentioned CsCl structures, while the entry given by the ICSD is a fcc based alloy. The volume discrepancy comes therefore from an erroneous export of the experimental data in the paper to the ICSD. Sn \u00b6 55% volume difference task_id: 7162 and icsd_id: 52487. This entry refers to a high pressure structure our algorithm did not catch. It is not surprising to see the computed data reporting a much larger volume than the experimental obtained at high-pressure TaMn 2 O 3 \u00b6 -27% volume difference task_id: 7521, icsd_id: 15995 The icsd indicates already that the experimental data is dubious. There is a warning on the ICSD web site: \"Unusual difference between calculated and measured density\". The oxidation state reported for Ta: +2 is extremely rare. MoS2 \u00b6 18% volume difference task_id: 1434, icsd_id: 644257 This is most likely due to an inherent error from GGA. The MoS2 structure is layered and van der Waals interactions between the S atoms are essential to the geometry of the structure (c lattice parameter especially). However, it is known that GGA does not model well VDW interactions. Citation \u00b6 To cite the Materials Project, please reference the following work: A. Jain, G. Hautier, C. J. Moore, S. P. Ong, C.

One way to keep returning users informed, seen on many websites, is a news feed. Such a feed consists of short entries, each with a date and summary of the news.

This format is based on that used by the Jekyll static site framework -- a simple organization of news items into separate files. The first section of the file (delimited by --- lines) is meta-data, aka \"front matter\", and will be pre-processed for relevant key-value pairs. The remainder of the file will be converted to HTML. This may be implemented in one pass, for example using the Python markdown package with it's built-in \"meta-data\" extension. The title is the only required piece of metadata.

Along with the elastic and piezoelectric tensors, the dielectric tensor provides all the information necessary for the solution of the constitutive equations in applications where electric and mechanical stresses are coupled. The dielectric tensors from the Materials Project (MP) are calculated from first principles Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) 1 and are approximated as the superimposed effect of an electronic and ionic contribution. From the full piezoelectric tensor, several properties are derived such as the refractive index and potential for ferroelectricity. Just as with the piezoelectric and elastic constants, multiple consistency checks are performed on all the calculated dielectric data to ensure its reliability and accuracy. Formalism \u00b6 Formally, the dielectric tensor \u03b5 relates the externally applied electric field to the field within the material and can be defined as: \\[ E_i=\\sum_j \\epsilon^{-1}_{ij}E_{0j} \\] where \\(E\\) is the electric field inside the material and \\(E_0\\) is the externally applied electric field. the indices i , j refer to the direction in space and take the values: \\({1, 2, 3}\\) . The dielectric tensor can be split in the ionic ( \\(\\epsilon_0\\) ) and electronic ( \\(\\epsilon*\\infty\\) ) contributions: \\[ \\epsilon_{ij}=\\epsilon_{ij}^0+\\epsilon_{ij}^\\infty \\] Here, we consider only the response of non-zero band gap materials to time-invariant fields. In the hypothetical case that a material does not respond at all to the external field, \\(\\epsilon_{ij}^\\infty\\) would be equal to the identity tensor and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}^0\\) would be zero. In fact, materials with zero ionic contribution do exist. In general, for \\(\\epsilon_{ij}^0\\) to be non-zero, compounds need to have at least 2 atoms per primitive cell, each having a different atomic charge. The dielectric tensor is symmetric and respects all the symmetry operations of the corresponding point group. This limits the number of independent elements in the tensor to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6 depending on the crystal symmetry. The dielectric response calculated herein corresponds to that of a single crystal. In polycrystalline samples, grains are oriented randomly and hence, the actual response will be different. Generally, the dielectric response varies with the frequency of the applied external field however here, we consider the static response (i.e., the response at constant electric fields or the long wavelength limit). Since the ionic contribution vanishes at high frequencies, our results can be used to obtain an estimate of the refractive index, n, at optical frequencies and far from resonance effects using the well known formula 2 : \\[ n=\\sqrt{\\epsilon^\\infty_{poly}} \\] where \\(\\epsilon^\\infty_{poly}\\) is the average of the eigenvalues of the electronic contribution to the dielectric tensor. It should be noted this equation for the refractive index assumes the material is non-magnetic. DFT Parameters \u00b6 The inital set of 1,056 dielectric tensors were calculated using the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package 3 4 5 6 (VASP version 5.3.4) combined with the Generalized Gradient Approximation GGA/PBE 7 8 +U 9 10 exchange-correlation functional and Projector Augmented Wave pseudopotentials 11 12 . The U values are energy corrections that address the spurious self-interaction energy introduced by GGA. Here, we used U values for d orbitals only that were fitted to experimental binary formation enthalpies using Wang et al. 13 method. The full list of U values used, can be found in ref. 10 . The k-point density was set at 3,000 per reciprocal atom and the plane wave energy cut-off at 600\u2009eV (ref. 4). For detailed information on the calculation of the dielectric tensor within the DFPT framework we refer to Baroni et al. 14 15 and Gonze & Lee 16 . Piezoelectricity calculations use the same DFPT methodology with a tighter parameter set to achieve convergence. As a result, the dielectric tensor is already converged in these calculations and is reported for any non-centrosymmetric material, not in the initial dataset of dielectrics. Benchmarking \u00b6 We see that in most cases, it is possible to predict the dielectric constant of materials with a relative deviation of less than +/\u221225% from experimental values at room temperature. Including local field effects gives the smallest mean absolute relative deviation ( MARD= 16.2 % for GGA). Furthermore, we note a tendency to overestimate rather than underestimate the dielectric constant relative to experiments, which is a well-known effect of DFPT 17 18 19 for the electronic contribution. Although it has often been related to the band gap underestimation problem of DFT, DFPT is a ground state theory and hence, the dielectric constant should, in principle, be described exactly 20 . In fact, as described by various authors, the problem is likely linked to the exchange-correlation functional 21 22 23 24 25 26 . Specifically, the exchange correlation functional has been found to depend on polarization but the actual dependence formula is, unfortunately, not known 27 28 29 . Additionally, the validity of GGA depends on the charge density varying slowly\u2014an assumption that may be broken when an external electric field is applied 30 .

Please see Elasticity calculations for details regarding the MP elasticity workflow 1 . For compounds that have not yet been processed with the elasticity workflow, the MP offers statistical learning (SL) predictions of the Voigt-Reuss-Hill 2 average bulk and shear moduli ( \\(K_{VRH}\\) and \\(G_{VRH}\\) , respectively). The SL models were trained with a diverse set of 1,940 k-nary compounds, using the \\(K_{VRH}\\) and \\(G_{VRH}\\) moduli calculated by the elasticity workflow. IMPORTANT NOTE : The SL predictions are generated by a local polynomial regression of several composition and structural descriptors (see Table 1) to available DFT-calculated elasticity data. They are not directly physics-based predictions and should not be viewed as having similar accuracy or precision to experimental or DFT data.See the SL paper 3 and Table 2 for prediction accuracy details. In addition, the SL predictions are based on a fraction of currently available DFT elasticity data. More sophisticated SL models with larger datasets are an objective for future work. Formalism \u00b6 Ensemble statistical learning techniques construct a predictor from a collection or ensemble of weak learners. Each weak learner is either a single descriptor or a function of just a few descriptors, which limits the level of interaction between descriptors. Gradient boosting (GB) is a very flexible ensemble technique, which makes few assumptions regarding the form of the solution and iteratively builds a predictor from a series of weak learners while minimizing the residual of a loss function 4 . GB implementations use regularization techniques to reduce the risk of over-fitting, which typically include limiting the level of interaction between descriptors, limiting the number of iterations per some risk criteria, and employing shrinkage 4 . At each iteration, the weak learner that causes the greatest reduction in the loss function\u2019s residual is selected and added to the model; however, when shrinkage is employed, each new term is attenuated by the learning rate. See the SL paper 3 and references therein for details about the regression model. Descriptors \u00b6 The successful application of SL requires a set of descriptor candidates that sufficiently explain the diversity of the phenomenon being learned. We distinguish between composition and structural descriptors. Composition descriptors are calculated from elemental properties and only require knowledge of a compound\u2019s composition. Structural descriptors require knowledge of a compound\u2019s specific structure and are calculated using DFT. The descriptors used for the final learned model and their relative influence (RI) are presented in Table 1.

The SL models were trained with a diverse set of 1,940 k-nary compounds, using the \\(K_{VRH}\\) and \\(G_{VRH}\\) moduli calculated by the elasticity workflow. IMPORTANT NOTE : The SL predictions are generated by a local polynomial regression of several composition and structural descriptors (see Table 1) to available DFT-calculated elasticity data. They are not directly physics-based predictions and should not be viewed as having similar accuracy or precision to experimental or DFT data.See the SL paper 3 and Table 2 for prediction accuracy details. In addition, the SL predictions are based on a fraction of currently available DFT elasticity data. More sophisticated SL models with larger datasets are an objective for future work.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"methodology/elasticity-prediction/#formalism","text":"Ensemble statistical learning techniques construct a predictor from a collection or ensemble of weak learners.

The process is started by performing an accurate structural relaxation for each structure, to a state of approximately zero stress. Subsequently, perturbations are applied to the lattice vectors and the resulting stress tensor is calculated from DFT, while allowing for relaxation of the ionic degrees of freedom. Finally, constitutive relations from linear elasticity, relating stress and strain, are employed to fit the full 6x6 elastic tensor. From this, aggregate properties such as Voigt and Reuss bounds on the bulk and shear moduli are derived. Multiple consistency checks are performed on all the calculated data to ensure its reliability and accuracy. Formalism \u00b6 The relaxed lattice vectors \\(\\{\\mathbf{a}_{1} , \\mathbf{a}_{2} , \\mathbf{a}_{3} \\}\\) are taken and these are deformed according to each of the 6 deformation gradients \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) as shown in the equations below. These 6 deformation gradients are applied one-by-one to the relaxed structure so that only one independent deformation is considered each time. For each of the 6 deformation modes, 4 different default magnitudes of deformation are applied: \\(\\delta_{1} \\in \\left\\{-0.01, -0.005, +0.005, +0.01\\right\\}\\) (pertaining to non shear-modes) and \\(\\delta_2 \\in \\left\\{ -0.06, -0.03, +0.03, +0.06 \\right\\}\\) (pertaining to shear-modes). This leads to a total of 24 deformed structures, for which the stress tensor, \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) , is calculated, allowing for relaxation of the ionic degrees of freedom. Note that in this work, conventional unit cells, obtained using pymatgen.symmetry.SpacegroupAnalyzer.get_conventional_standard_structure are employed for all elastic constant calculations. In our experience, these cells typically yield more accurate and better converged elastic constants than primitive cells, at the cost of more computational time. We suspect this has to do with the fact that unit cells often exhibit higher symmetries and simpler Brillouin zones than primitive cells (an example is face centered cubic cells). \\[ \\boldsymbol{F}= \\left[{\\begin{matrix} 1 + \\delta _{1} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\end{matrix}}\\right] \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{F}= \\left[{\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 + \\delta _{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\end{matrix}}\\right] \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{F}= \\left[{\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 + \\delta _{1} \\\\ \\end{matrix}}\\right] \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{F}= \\left[{\\begin{matrix} 1 & \\delta _{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\end{matrix}}\\right] \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{F}= \\left[{\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & \\delta _{2} \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\end{matrix}}\\right] \\] \\[ \\boldsymbol{F}= \\left[{\\begin{matrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\delta _{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \\end{matrix}}\\right] \\] \\[ \\mathbf{E}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{F^T} \\mathbf{F} - \\mathbf{I}) \\] We employ the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) , in this work, defined above. The 6x6 elastic tensor is calculated from the equation below, with \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) again the Green-Lagrange strain tensor and \\(\\mathbf{S}\\) the calculated stress tensor. The components are calculated from a linear least-squares-fit if stress versus strain. We make use of the following Voigt-notation in this work: \\(11 \\mapsto 1\\) , \\(22 \\mapsto 2\\) , \\(33 \\mapsto 3\\) , \\(23 \\mapsto 4\\) , \\(13 \\mapsto 5\\) , \\(12 \\mapsto 6\\) . \\[ \\left[ \\begin{matrix} S_{11} \\\\ S_{22} \\\\ S_{33} \\\\ S_{23} \\\\ S_{13} \\\\ S_{12} \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{13} & C_{14} & C_{15} & C_{16} \\\\ C_{12} & C_{22} & C_{23} & C_{24} & C_{25} & C_{26} \\\\ C_{13} & C_{23} & C_{33} & C_{34} & C_{35} & C_{36} \\\\ C_{14} & C_{24} & C_{34} & C_{44} & C_{45} & C_{46} \\\\ C_{15} & C_{25} & C_{35} & C_{45} & C_{55} & C_{56} \\\\ C_{16} & C_{26} & C_{36} & C_{46} & C_{56} & C_{66} \\\\ \\end{matrix} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{matrix} E_{11} \\\\ E_{22} \\\\ E_{33} \\\\ 2 E_{23} \\\\ 2 E_{13} \\\\ 2 E_{12} \\end{matrix} \\right] \\] Different choices of lattice vectors with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system may lead to elastic tensors that look different from what might be expected. For example, for the hexagonal crystal system it is commonly stated that \\(C_{11} = C_{22}\\) . However, this is true under the conditions that lattice vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}_{2}\\) are both in the basal plane, whereas \\(\\mathbf{a}_{3}\\) is orthogonal to the basal plane. Hence, the elastic tensor can only be completely specified when the lattice vectors are expressed in a given coordinate system. To avoid confusion, we present the elastic tensor in 2 ways. First, the elastic tensor is presented for the exact choice of lattice vectors as presented on the Materials Project webpage. This is consistent with the cif-file of the \"conventional standard\" structure, which can also be downloaded from the Materials Project webpage. Elastic tensors can also be expressed in a standard format according to the IEEE standard. The standardized IEEE-format specifies the precise choice of lattice vectors in a coordinate system and thereby unambiguously defines the components of the elastic tensor 1 . In most cases, the elastic tensors in the POSCAR-format and the IEEE-format are identical. When the elastic tensor in POSCAR-format and IEEE-format are not identical however, they are related by a rotation. Note that IEEE tensors can be obtained using the get_ieee_tensor method for any of the subclasses of pymatgen.analysis.elasticity.tensors.TensorBase (which include ElasticTensor and PiezoTensor). Derived elastic properties \u00b6 From the elastic tensor defined above, a number of aggregate and derived properties is calculated. These properties are all available on the Materials Project webpage and are shown in the Table 1. As described above, the elastic tensor is presented in POSCAR-format. From the elastic tensor in POSCAR-format, the compliance tensor is calculated and reported. Also reported are Voigt, Reuss and Voigt-Reuss-Hill 2 bounds on the bulk and shear moduli for polycrystalline materials. Finally, the elastic anisotropy index 3 and isotropic Poisson ratio are reported.

This typically means that more precise DFT-parameters have to be employed, compared to for example a simple total energy-calculation. Careful convergence testing and comparison to experimental results has led to a set of DFT-parameters that yield elastic constants, converged to within approximately 5 % for over 95 % of the systems. In choosing DFT-parameters for the calculations, we distinguish between metals and metallic compounds (metallics) on one hand and semiconductors and insulators (non-metallics) on the other hand. The most relevant DFT-parameters used in our HT-calculations are shown in Table 2. K-point density is expressed in per-reciprocal-atom (pra). The first-principles results presented in this work are performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method 3 4 as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) 5 6 7 . In all calculations, we employ the Perdew, Becke and Ernzerhof (PBE) 8 Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. As described in the literature, several filters are used to detect cases where the elastic tensor might not have been converged properly. For those cases, the calculation is repeated but now with more stringent DFT-convergence parameters. Hence, the numerical values in Table 2 are representative for our calculations, but in some cases more strict parameters have been used. The calculation details for each compound can be found on the Materials Project webpage.

This typically means that more precise DFT-parameters have to be employed, compared to for example a simple total energy-calculation. Careful convergence testing and comparison to experimental results has led to a set of DFT-parameters that yield elastic constants, converged to within approximately 5 % for over 95 % of the systems. In choosing DFT-parameters for the calculations, we distinguish between metals and metallic compounds (metallics) on one hand and semiconductors and insulators (non-metallics) on the other hand. The most relevant DFT-parameters used in our HT-calculations are shown in Table 2. K-point density is expressed in per-reciprocal-atom (pra). The first-principles results presented in this work are performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method 3 4 as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) 5 6 7 . In all calculations, we employ the Perdew, Becke and Ernzerhof (PBE) 8 Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. As described in the literature, several filters are used to detect cases where the elastic tensor might not have been converged properly. For those cases, the calculation is repeated but now with more stringent DFT-convergence parameters. Hence, the numerical values in Table 2 are representative for our calculations, but in some cases more strict parameters have been used. The calculation details for each compound can be found on the Materials Project webpage.

This data is available for many entries in the materials explorer. We ran first a static run with a uniform (Monkhorst Pack or \\(\\Gamma\\) -centered for hexagonal systems) k-point grid. From this run the DOS and the charge density were extracted. The charge density was then used to perform a band structure computation for k-points along the symmetry lines of the Brillouin zone. The symmetry lines have been determined following the methodology from Curtarolo et al. 1 using the aconvasp software. The band structure data is displayed with full lines for up spin and dashed lines for down spin. For insulators, the band gap is computed according to the band structure. The nature of the gap (direct or undirect) as well as the k-points involved in the band gap transition are displayed. The VBM and CBMs are displayed for insulators as well by red and white dots. The web site does not display the 10% highest bands as those higher energies bands tend to converge more slowly. The DOS indicates the full DOS by default but projections along atoms or orbitals are also available through a scroll down menu. Please note that the DOS data and band structure can be slightly different as the k-point grid is not the same. For instance, the k-point grid for the DOS might not include Gamma while the band structure does. Accuracy of Band Structures \u00b6 Note : the term 'band gap' in this section generally refers to the fundamental gap, not the optical gap. The difference between these quantities is reported to be small in semiconductors but significant in insulators. 2 Figure 1: Experimental versus computed band gaps for 237 compounds in an internal test. The computed gaps are underestimated by an average factor of 1.6, and the residual error even after accounting for this shift is significant (MAE of 0.6 eV). We thank M. Chan for her assistance in compiling this data. Density functional theory is formulated to calculate ground state properties. Although the band structure involves excitations of electrons to unoccupied states, the Kohn-Sham energies used in solving the DFT equations are often interpreted to correspond to electron energy levels in the solid. The correspondence between the Kohm-Sham eigenvalues computed by DFT and true electron energies is theoretically valid only for the highest occupied electron state. The Kohn-Sham energy of this state matches the first ionization energy of the material, given an exact exchange-correlation functional. However, for other energies, there is no guarantee that Kohn-Sham eigenvalues will correspond to physical observables. Despite the lack of a rigorous theoretical basis, the DFT band structure does provide useful information. In general, band dispersions predicted by DFT are reported to match experimental observations; one small test of band dispersion accuracy found that errors ranged from 0.1 to about 0.4 eV. 3 However, predicted band gaps are usually severely underestimated. Therefore, a common way to interpret DFT band structures is to apply a 'scissor' operation whereby the conduction bands are shifted in energy by a constant amount so that the band gap matches known experimental observations. Band gaps \u00b6 In general, band gaps computed with common exchange-correlation functionals such as the LDA and GGA are severely underestimated. Typically the disagreement is reported to be around 50% in the literature. Some internal testing by the Materials Project supports these statements; typically, we find that band gaps are underestimated by about 40% (Figure 1). We additionally find that several known insulators are predicted to be metallic. Origin of band gap error and improving accuracy \u00b6 The errors in DFT band gaps obtained from calculations can be attributed to two sources: 1. Approximations employed to the exchange correlation functional 2. A derivative discontinuity term, originating from the true density functional being discontinuous with the total number of electrons in the system. Of these contributions, (2) is generally regarded to be the larger and more important contribution to the error.

Strategies to improve band gap prediction at moderate to low computational cost now been developed by several groups, including Chan and Ceder (delta-sol), 4 Heyd et al. (hybrid functionals) 5 , and Setyawan et al. (empirical fits) 6 . (These references also contain additional data regarding the accuracy of DFT band gaps.) The Materials Project may employ such methods in the future in order to more quantitatively predict band gaps. For the moment, computed band gaps should be interpreted with caution.

These excitations can be decomposed into different modes, each being associated with an energy that corresponds to the frequency of the vibration. The different energies associated with each vibrational mode constitute the phonon vibrational spectra (or phonon band structure). The vibrational spectra of materials play an important role in physical phenomena such as thermal conductivity, superconductivity, ferroelectricity and carrier thermalization. There are different methods to calculate the vibrational spectra from first-principles using the density functional theory formalism (DFT). It can be obtained from the Fourier transform of the trajectories of the atoms on a molecular dynamics run, from finite-differences of the total energy with respect to atomic displacements or directly from density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The latter method is the one used in the calculations on the Materials project page. Formalism \u00b6 In the density functional perturbation theory formalism the derivatives of the total energy with respect to a perturbation are directly obtained from the self-consistency loop 1 For a generic point q in the Brillouin zone the phonon frequencies \\(\\omega\\_{\\mathbf{q},m}\\) and eigenvectors \\(U_m(\\mathbf{q}\\kappa'\\beta)\\) are obtained by solving of the generalized eigenvalue problem \\[\\sum*{\\kappa'\\beta}\\widetilde{C}*{\\kappa\\alpha,\\kappa'\\beta}(\\mathbf{q})U*m(\\mathbf{q}\\kappa'\\beta) = M*{\\kappa}\\omega^2\\_{\\mathbf{q},m}U_m(\\mathbf{q}\\kappa\\alpha),\\] where \\(\\kappa\\) labels the atoms in the cell, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are cartesian coordinates and \\(\\widetilde{C}\\_{\\kappa\\alpha,\\kappa'\\beta}(\\mathbf{q})\\) are the interatomic force constants in reciprocal space, which are related to the second derivatives of the energy with respect to atomic displacements. These values have been obtained by performing a Fourier interpolation of those calculated on a regular grid of q -points obtained with DFPT.

This is often referred to as the direct piezoelectric effect. Conversely, the indirect piezoelectric effect refers to the case when a strain is generated in a material upon the application of an electric field. The mathematical description of piezoelectricity relates the strain (or stress) to the electric field via a third order tensor. This tensor describes the response of any piezoelectric bulk material, when subjected to an electric field or a mechanical load. The piezoelectric constants from the Materials Project (MP) are calculated from first principles Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) 1 and are approximated as the superimposed effect of an electronic and ionic contribution. From the full piezoelectric tensor, several properties are derived such as the maximum longitudinal piezoelectric modulus and the corresponding crystallographic direction. Just as with the elastic constants, multiple consistency checks are performed on all the calculated piezoelectric data to ensure its reliability and accuracy. Figure 1: longitudinal piezoelectric modulus-surface for a cubic compound, showing the maximum response in the <111> family of directions. Formalism \u00b6 In this work, we calculate the piezoelectric stress coefficients, \\(\\textstyle e_{ijk}^{T}\\) from DFPT, with units of \\(\\textstyle C/m^{2}\\) . These can be defined in terms of thermodynamic derivatives as shown below 2 . \\[ e_{ijk}^{T}= \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{i}}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{jk}}\\right)_{E, T} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{jk}}{\\partial E_{i}}\\right)_{\\varepsilon, T} \\! \\] where \\(\\textstyle D\\) , \\(\\textstyle E\\) , \\(\\textstyle \\varepsilon\\) , \\(\\textstyle \\sigma\\) and \\(\\textstyle T\\) represent the electric displacement field, the electric field, the strain tensor, the stress tensor and the temperature, respectively. The above relations can be written in Voigt-notation as shown below. \\[ e_{ij}^{T}= \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{i}}{\\partial \\varepsilon_{j}}\\right)_{E, T} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{j}}{\\partial E_{i}}\\right)_{\\varepsilon, T} \\! \\] We note that the most commonly used piezoelectric constants appearing in the (experimental) literature are the piezoelectric strain constants, usually denoted by \\(\\textstyle d_{ijk}\\) . These can be readily related to the constants \\(\\textstyle e_{ijk}\\) if the elastic compliances \\(\\textstyle s_{lmjk}^{T}\\) (at constant electric field and temperature) of the materials are known: \\(\\textstyle d_{ijk}^{T} = e_{ilm} s_{lmjk}^{ET}\\) . In particular, the piezoelectric strain constants can be expressed thermodynamically as shown below \\[ d_{kij}^{T} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{ij}}{\\partial E_{k}}\\right)_{\\sigma, T} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial D_{k}}{\\partial \\sigma_{ij}}\\right)_{E, T} \\! \\] It is well-known that the piezoelectric behavior can only occur in crystals that lack inversion symmetry. This is the direct consequence of the symmetry properties of the piezoelectric tensor, which is of order 3. Another fundamental requirement for piezoelectric behavior is that the material has a band gap. Combined, these criteria severely limit the amount of compounds in nature that have the potential to exhibit piezoelectric behavior. For the Materials Project in particular, potential piezoelectric materials in the database are identified by i) allowing only structures with space groups 1, 3-9, 16-46, 75-82, 89-122, 143-146, 149-161, 168-174, 177-190, 195-199, 207-220 (since these space groups lack inversion symmetry), and in addition ii) the calculated DFT bandgap of the material > 0.1 eV. Compounds in the Materials Project database that satisfy these criteria are selected for a full-DFT calculation of the piezoelectric tensor and derived properties (see below). Derived piezoelectric properties \u00b6 For elastic properties, which are based on a tensor of order 4, isotropic Voigt and Reuss averages can be derived on the bulk and shear moduli. For piezoelectric properties, this isotropic averaging-approach does not quite work due to the requirement that inversion symmetry cannot occur in piezoelectric materials. On MP, in addition to the piezoelectric tensor in Voigt-notation, we report the maximum longitudinal piezoelectric modulus of the compound and the corresponding crystallographic direction in which this occurs. One can think of these quantities as the piezoelectric counterpart of the well-known Young's modulus and the stiffest elastic direction in the context of elasticity-theory. Fig. 1 shows an example of how the longitudinal piezoelectric modulus can be represented in 3D. This is for the case of a cubic material. As can be seen clearly, the maximum modulus occurs in the <111> family of crystallographic directions. By symmetry, this is always the case for cubic piezoelectric materials. Fig. 2 shows a more complicated longitudinal piezoelectric modulus-surface for an orthorhombic compound. In that case, the relative magnitudes of the tensor components dictate in which crystallographic direction, the maximum response occurs. Finally, note that for some compounds, a piezoelectric response is only induced by shear deformation rather than tensile or compressive deformation. For these cases, the response cannot be depicted such as in Figs. 1 and 2. The representations such as in Figs. 1 and 2 and created using the open-source MTEX package 3 4 5 . Figure 2: longitudinal piezoelectric modulus-surface for an orthorhombic compound. DFT parameters \u00b6 The first-principles results presented in this work are performed using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). In all calculations, we employ the Perdew, Becke and Ernzerhof (PBE) Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. A cut-off for the plane waves of 1000 eV is used and a uniform k-point density of approximately 2,000 per reciprocal atom (pra) is employed, which means that the number of atoms per cell multiplied by the number of k-points equals approximately 2,000. For the compounds that contain magnetic elements, a ferromagnetic state is initialized in the calculation. Similarly to our previous work, we expect to correctly converge to ferromagnetic and non-magnetic states in this way, but not to anti-ferromagnetic states. Due to the presence of strongly correlated electrons in some of the oxides, the GGA+U method is employed, with U representing the Hubbard-parameter. The values of U are chosen consistent with those employed in MP. Figure 3: A graphical representation of the piezoelectric dataset, currently containing over 900 materials. A series of concentric circles indicate constant values of the maximum longitudinal piezoelectric modulus, \\(e_{ij,max}\\) . The compounds are broken up according to the crystal system and the different point group symmetry-classes considered in this work. See the paper A database to enable discovery and design of piezoelectric materials for details. Crystal symmetry \u00b6 The crystal symmetry and in particular the point group dictates the symmetry of the piezoelectric tensor, relates components of the tensor to each other and imposes that certain components equal zero. All piezoelectric tensors in the Materials Project have been symmetrized for consistency with the underlying point group of the compound. Figure 4 gives an overview of the symmetrized piezoelectric tensors in MP, broken up by the different piezoelectric point groups. Also, typical surface representations are shown. The point group that only yields piezoelectric behavior upon the application of shear is not included in the representation in Fig. 4. Figure 4: Piezoelectric tensors and symmetry classes considered in this work. Typical representations of the longitudinal piezoelectric modulus in 3D are also shown for each crystal point group. Note that depending on the components of the piezoelectric tensor, the surface representation can differ from those shown here.

This approach not only reduces the electron number but also the energy cutoff necessary (this is critical in plane-wave based computations). All computations in the materials project have been performed using a specific type of very efficient pseudopotentials: the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials. 1 We used the library of PAW pseudopotentials provided by VASP but for a given element there are often several possibilities in the VASP library. This wiki presents how the choices between the different pseudopotential options were made. The strategy \u00b6 As a test set, we ran all elements and binary oxides present in the ICSD with the available PAW pseudopotentials. As it is difficult to test for all properties (structural, electronic, etc...), we chose to be inclusive and to select the pseudopotential (psp) with the largest number of electrons (high e) EXCEPT if convergence issues were seen on our test set, or if previous experience excluded a specific pseudopotential. We also excluded pseudopotentials with too large an energy cutoff. We also compared to recommendations from the VASP manual present in 1 . Finally, as we had energies for elements and binary oxides, we compared binary oxide formation energies with the available pseudopotentials. The oxygen molecule energy was obtained from Wang et al. Please note that this data is pure GGA and some chemistries (e.g., transition metals) will give extremely bad formation energy results in GGA.

Pb is interesting as the high e- psp shows significantly higher error in formation energies. We kept the high e- psp (Pb_d), but it might be interesting to study this a little more. One hypothesis relies on a recent result showing that lead oxide formation energies need the use of spin-orbit coupling to be accurate. 2 Our computations do not include any relativistic corrections for valence electrons. However, spin-orbit coupling is taken into account during the psp construction. This would explain why a psp with more core electrons (treated undirectly with SO coupling) would give more accurate results than a psp with fewer electrons.

Here is what the VASP manual says about them: \"Due to self-interaction errors, f-electrons are not handled well by presently available density functionals. In particular, partially filled states are often incorrectly described, leading to large errors for Pr-Eu and Tb-Yb where the error increases in the middle (Gd is handled reasonably well, since 7 electrons occupy the majority shell). These errors are DFT and not VASP related. Particularly problematic is the description of the transition from an itinerant (band-like) behavior observed at the beginning of each period to localized states towards the end of the period. For the elements, this transition occurs already in La and Ce, whereas the transition sets in for Pu and Am for the elements. A routine way to cope with the inabilities of present DFT functionals to describe the localized electrons is to place the electrons in the core. Such potentials are available and described below. Furthermore, PAW potentials in which the states are treated as valence states are available, but these potentials are not expected to work reliable when the electrons are localized.\" In summary, the pseudopotentials can either include or not include f electrons; how accurate including them or not is depends on the nature of the bonding for each particular system (localized or not). What we found is that convergence issues are often seen for high electron psp (e.g., Pr, Nd, Sm). Also, some pseudopotentials (e.g., Er_2, Eu_2) freeze too many electrons and therefore have issues with oxidation states that make one of the frozen electron participate in bonding (e.g., Eu2O3, Er2O3). Finally, there is a major problem with Tb. Only Tb_3 exists but Tb is known to also form Tb4+ compounds (e.g., TbO2). For those Tb4+ compounds, this psp is likely to be extremely wrong.

For the exchange-correlational functional, we employ a mix of Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and GGA+ U , as described later in this manual . We use the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method for modeling core electrons with an energy cutoff of 520 eV. This cutoff corresponds to 1.3 times the highest cutoff recommended among all the pseudopotentials we use (more details can be found in the Pseudopotentials Choice manual). All calculations are performed at 0K and 0atm. All computations are performed with spin polarization on and with magnetic ions in a high-spin ferromagnetic initialization (the system can of course relax to a low spin state during the DFT relaxation). We used a k-point mesh of 1000/(number of atoms in the cell) for all computations, the Monkhorst-Pack method for the k-point choices (but \\(\\Gamma\\) -centered for hexagonal cells) and the tetrahedron method to perform the k-point integration. Pymatgen could change those default parameters if they are not adequate for the computation (e.g., switch to another k-point integration scheme). Some details of our calculation method can be found in ref 2 ; however, the Materials Project has updated many parameters as documented throughout the Methodology sections. Crystal structures \u00b6 We use input structures from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), 3 and relax all cell and atomic positions in our calculation two times in consecutive runs. When multiple crystal structures are present for a single chemical composition, we attempt to evaluate all unique structures as determined by an affine mapping technique. 4 Total energy convergence \u00b6 We currently employ a k-point mesh of 1000 per reciprocal atom (pra). We performed a convergence test of total energy with respect to k-point density and convergence energy difference for a subset of chemically diverse compounds for a previous parameter set, which employed a smaller k-point mesh of 500 pra. Using a 500 pra k-point mesh, the numerical convergence for most compounds tested was within 5 meV/atom, and 96% of compounds tested were converged to within 15 meV/atom. Results for the new parameter set will be better due to the denser k-point mesh employed. Convergence will depend on chemical system; for example, oxides were generally converged to less than 1 meV/atom. 6 Structure convergence \u00b6 The energy difference for ionic convergence is set to 0.0005 * natoms in the cell. Data on expected accuracy on cell volumes can be found in a previous paper. 2 We have found these parameters to yield well-converged structures in most instances; however, if the structures are to be used for further calculations that require strictly converged atomic positions and cell parameters (e.g. elastic constants, phonon modes, etc.), we recommend that users re-optimize the structures with tighter cutoffs or in force convergence mode. Total Energy Adjustments \u00b6 To better model energies across diverse chemical spaces, we apply several adjustments to the total energy. These adjustments fall into two categories, each of which is briefly described below. Our correction scheme assumes independent, linear corrections associated with each corrected element. For example, \\(\\ce{VO_2}\\) would receive both a 'V' and an 'oxide' correction (as explained below), while elemental \\(\\ce{V}\\) would receive no corrections. For complete details of our correction scheme, refer to Wang et al 5 Anion corrections \u00b6 For many elements that take on negative oxidation states in solids, differences in electron localization between the elements and the solid can result in substantial errors in formation energies computed from DFT calculations. This is especially true for elements that are gaseous in their standard state - \\(\\ce{O2}\\) , \\(\\ce{N2}\\) , \\(\\ce{Cl2}\\) , \\(\\ce{F2}\\) , and \\(\\ce{H2}\\) . To address this, we adjust the energies of materials containing certain elements by applying a correction to anionic species, as explained in ref 5 . Specifically, we apply energy corrections to 14 anion species -- 'oxide', 'peroxide', 'superoxide', \\(\\ce{S}\\) , \\(\\ce{F}\\) , \\(\\ce{Cl}\\) , \\(\\ce{Br}\\) , \\(\\ce{I}\\) , \\(\\ce{N}\\) , \\(\\ce{H}\\) , \\(\\ce{Se}\\) , \\(\\ce{Si}\\) , \\(\\ce{Sb}\\) , and \\(\\ce{Te}\\) . In the case of oxygen-containing compounds, separate corrections are applied to oxides, superoxides, and peroxides based on the specific bonding environment of oxygen in the material, as determined from nearest-neighbor bond lengths (e.g., <1.35 \u00c5 for superoxide, <1.49 \u00c5 for 'peroxide', and 'oxide' otherwise). Thus, \\(\\ce{Na_2O}\\) receives an 'oxide' correction while \\(\\ce{NaO_2}\\) receives a `superoxide' correction. Anion corrections are applied tto a material only when it contains a corrected element as an anion. For example, the `H''correction is applied to LiH but not to H \\(_2\\) O. A specie is classified as an anion if its estimated oxidation state (when available) is negative, or if it is the most electronegative element in the formula. GGA / GGA+ U Mixing Corrections \u00b6 Some compounds are better modeled with a U correction term to the density functional theory Hamiltonian while others are better modeled without (i.e., regular GGA). Energies from calculations with the + U correction are not directly comparable to those without. To obtain better accuracy across chemical systems, we use GGA+ U when appropriate, GGA otherwise, and mix energies from the two calculation methodologies by adding an energy correction term to the GGA+ U calculations to make them comparable to the GGA calculations. Specifically, we use GGA+ U for oxide and fluoride compounds containing any of the transition metals \\(\\ce{V}\\) , \\(\\ce{Cr}\\) , \\(\\ce{Mn}\\) , \\(\\ce{Fe}\\) , \\(\\ce{Co}\\) , \\(\\ce{Ni}\\) , \\(\\ce{W}\\) , and \\(\\ce{Mo}\\) , and GGA for everything else. More details on this method can be found in ref 5 and 7 . Accuracy of Total Energies \u00b6 To estimate the accuracy of our total energy calculations, we compute reaction data and compare against experimental data. Note that this data set was compiled using a lower k-point mesh and pseudopotentials with fewer electrons than the current Materials Project parameter set. Estimating errors in calculated reaction energies \u00b6 The accuracy of calculated reaction energies depends on the chemical system investigated. In general, GGA calculations have similar errors among chemically similar systems. Hence, reaction energies between chemically similar systems (e.g., a reaction where the reactants and products are all oxides, such as \\(\\ce{MgO + Al2O3 -> MgAl2O4}\\) ) tend to have smaller errors than reactions between chemically dissimilar systems (e.g., between metals and insulators). Figure 1: Errors in Calculated Formation Energies for 413 binaries in the Kubaschewski Tables. Energies are normalized to per mol atom. To provide a quantitative indicator of the error we may expect from the reaction calculator, we have computed the reaction energies of 413 binaries in the Kubaschewski Tables formed with Group V, VI and VII anions. Figure 1 shows the errors in the calculated formation energies (compared to the experimental values) for these compounds. The mean absolute error (MAE) is around 14 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . 75% of the calculated formation energies are within 20 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . We also found that compounds of certain elements tend to have larger errors. For example, Bi, Co, Pb, Eu, U, Tl and W compounds often have errors larger than 20 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . It should be noted that while an MAE of 14 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) is significantly higher than the desired chemical accuracy of 4 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) , it compares fairly well with the performance of most quantum chemistry calculations 8 . Other than the most computationally expensive model chemistries such as G1-G3 and CBS, the reaction energy errors of most computational chemistry model chemistries are well above 10 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . For oxidation of the elements into binary compounds, an average error of ~4% or 33 kJ/mol- \\(\\ce{O2}\\) is typical. 9 For conventional ternary oxide formation from the elements, we have found a mean relative absolute error of about 2%. 9 Sources of error \u00b6 The largest contribution to the error comes from the inability of the GGA to fully describe electronic exchange and correlation effects. In addition, there is some error associated with neglecting zero-point effects and with comparing 0K, 0atm computations with room-temperature enthalpy experiments. The latter effect was estimated to contribute less than 0.03 eV/atom by Lany. 10 The stability of antiferromagnetic compounds may be underestimated, as the majority of our calculations are performed ferromagnetically only. The effect of magnetism may be small (under 10 meV/atom) or large (100 meV/atom or greater), depending on the compound. For compounds with heavy elements, relativistic effects may lead to greater-than-expected errors. GGA errors on reaction energies between chemically similar compounds \u00b6 We recently conducted a more in-depth study comparing GGA (+U) reaction energies of ternary oxides from binary oxides on 135 compounds. 11 The main conclusions are: The error in reaction energies for the binary oxide to ternary oxides reaction energies are an order of magnitude lower than for the more often reported formation energies from the element. An error intrinsic to GGA (+U) is estimated to follow a normal distribution centered in zero (no systematic underestimation or overestimation) and with a standard deviation around 24 meV/at. When looking at phase stability (and for instance assessing if a phase is stable or not), the relevant reaction energies are most of the time not the formation energies from the elements but reaction energies from chemically similar compounds (e.g., two oxides forming a third oxide). Large cancelation of errors explain this observation. The +U is necessary for accurate description of the energetics evene when reactions do not involve change in formal oxidation states Accuracy of Calculated Volumes \u00b6 A discussion of errors in calculated volumes can be found in the Volume Change Error manual .

For the exchange-correlational functional, we employ a mix of Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) and GGA+ U , as described later in this manual . We use the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method for modeling core electrons with an energy cutoff of 520 eV. This cutoff corresponds to 1.3 times the highest cutoff recommended among all the pseudopotentials we use (more details can be found in the Pseudopotentials Choice manual). All calculations are performed at 0K and 0atm. All computations are performed with spin polarization on and with magnetic ions in a high-spin ferromagnetic initialization (the system can of course relax to a low spin state during the DFT relaxation). We used a k-point mesh of 1000/(number of atoms in the cell) for all computations, the Monkhorst-Pack method for the k-point choices (but \\(\\Gamma\\) -centered for hexagonal cells) and the tetrahedron method to perform the k-point integration. Pymatgen could change those default parameters if they are not adequate for the computation (e.g., switch to another k-point integration scheme).

Using a 500 pra k-point mesh, the numerical convergence for most compounds tested was within 5 meV/atom, and 96% of compounds tested were converged to within 15 meV/atom. Results for the new parameter set will be better due to the denser k-point mesh employed.

For complete details of our correction scheme, refer to Wang et al 5","title":"Total Energy Adjustments"},{"location":"methodology/total-energies/#anion-corrections","text":"For many elements that take on negative oxidation states in solids, differences in electron localization between the elements and the solid can result in substantial errors in formation energies computed from DFT calculations.

To address this, we adjust the energies of materials containing certain elements by applying a correction to anionic species, as explained in ref 5 .

In the case of oxygen-containing compounds, separate corrections are applied to oxides, superoxides, and peroxides based on the specific bonding environment of oxygen in the material, as determined from nearest-neighbor bond lengths (e.g., <1.35 \u00c5 for superoxide, <1.49 \u00c5 for 'peroxide', and 'oxide' otherwise). Thus, \\(\\ce{Na_2O}\\) receives an 'oxide' correction while \\(\\ce{NaO_2}\\) receives a `superoxide' correction.

In general, GGA calculations have similar errors among chemically similar systems. Hence, reaction energies between chemically similar systems (e.g., a reaction where the reactants and products are all oxides, such as \\(\\ce{MgO + Al2O3 -> MgAl2O4}\\) ) tend to have smaller errors than reactions between chemically dissimilar systems (e.g., between metals and insulators). Figure 1: Errors in Calculated Formation Energies for 413 binaries in the Kubaschewski Tables. Energies are normalized to per mol atom. To provide a quantitative indicator of the error we may expect from the reaction calculator, we have computed the reaction energies of 413 binaries in the Kubaschewski Tables formed with Group V, VI and VII anions. Figure 1 shows the errors in the calculated formation energies (compared to the experimental values) for these compounds. The mean absolute error (MAE) is around 14 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . 75% of the calculated formation energies are within 20 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . We also found that compounds of certain elements tend to have larger errors. For example, Bi, Co, Pb, Eu, U, Tl and W compounds often have errors larger than 20 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) . It should be noted that while an MAE of 14 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) is significantly higher than the desired chemical accuracy of 4 kJ mol \\(^{-1}\\) , it compares fairly well with the performance of most quantum chemistry calculations 8 .

In addition, there is some error associated with neglecting zero-point effects and with comparing 0K, 0atm computations with room-temperature enthalpy experiments. The latter effect was estimated to contribute less than 0.03 eV/atom by Lany. 10 The stability of antiferromagnetic compounds may be underestimated, as the majority of our calculations are performed ferromagnetically only. The effect of magnetism may be small (under 10 meV/atom) or large (100 meV/atom or greater), depending on the compound.

An error intrinsic to GGA (+U) is estimated to follow a normal distribution centered in zero (no systematic underestimation or overestimation) and with a standard deviation around 24 meV/at. When looking at phase stability (and for instance assessing if a phase is stable or not), the relevant reaction energies are most of the time not the formation energies from the elements but reaction energies from chemically similar compounds (e.g., two oxides forming a third oxide).

Currently, this app contains more than 4,000 intercalation compounds and 16,000 conversion compounds with different types of working ions (such as Li, Mg, Zn, Al and more). These numbers will increase as new compounds are continuously added to the database, including many new structural predictions. Searching Using the Battery Explorer \u00b6 The battery explorer is designed to help battery scientists find electrode materials of interest. There are a number of search fields that can be used to filter all the battery material entries to customize the results returned. Every battery material entry compiles multiple material entries that represent a given battery electrode at different states of charge and the corresponding data analysis to predict useful battery properties such as voltage or change in volume. The search bar above the periodic table in the battery explorer app can be used to search for battery material entries based on the composition (either by typying into the search bar or clicking on the periodic table to specify elements), by Material ID, or by Battery ID. In the toolbar to the right of the periodic table, there are a number of additional criteria that can be used to filter the results: Number of Elements (including the working ion) Excluded Elements Toggle select between Intercalation Compounds or Conversion Compounds Type of Working Ion Average Voltage in V with respect to the voltage of the pure metal for the corresponding working ion Volumetric Capacity in Ah/L Gravimetric Capacity (also known as Specific Capacity) in (mAh/g) At the bottom of the toolbar to the right of the periodic table, a number of advanced search options can be expanded: Max Voltage Step in V Max Volume Change in fractional units (for example 1 corresponds to 100% volume change) Max Instability in eV/atom determined from the energy above hull metric (see glossary for more information) The Search Results Table \u00b6 The search results table presents the resulting battery material entries from your search. You can add or hide fields from the result table by clicking the \"Show/ hide columns\" button and filter the results based on these fields by clicking the arrow in the column of interest. There are also buttons to print or export the Search Results Table to save your results for future reference. To investigate an individual battery material entry, click on one of the rows in the Search Results Table. This will open a new page containing a detailed summary for that entry including links and additional information for each material entry associated with a given battery material entry and data analysis such as the predicted voltage profile, oxidative stability, volume change, etc. Viewing Details of a Battery Material \u00b6 Within a single battery material entry, each associated material entry is dedicated to one structural framework that represents a different state of charge or working ion intercalation level (e.g. \\(\\ce{Mn2O4}\\) spinel, \\(\\ce{Li0.5Mn2O4}\\) spinel, or \\(\\ce{LiMn2O4}\\) spinel). These entries have been grouped together into a single battery material entry by comparing the structure frameworks with the working ion(s) removed to match similar host lattices. The details view has many components and more detailed data analysis from these grouped entries (including interactive plots and features) which are described below. Voltage Curve \u00b6 The voltage curve graph displays the calculated equilibrium voltage versus state of charge. If voltage criteria were specified in the query, the line might be segmented into different colors. Try hovering over points on the voltage curve plot with your mouse for more details on that data point. O 2 Evolution Curve \u00b6 One concern for battery electrode design is resistance to \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) release, as \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) release from an electrode can lead to thermal runaway which is a safety hazard. The \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) evolution diagram determines the equilibrium chemical potentials at which \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) release can be expected, and the amount of \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) released 1 2 . One way to read this chart is to look at the chemical potential at which \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) release begins (the first x-value for which the y-axis is greater than zero). Compounds for which O2 release begins at more negative muO2 are more stable with respect to \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) release. The \\(\\mu_\\ce{O_2}\\) needed for release can be referenced against established battery compounds to get an idea of stability to \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) release. This plot is interactive so you can hover over a data point with your mouse for more detailed information. Structure Viewer \u00b6 For viewing convenience, there is a drop down list below the structure viewer window where you can select the structure of each material entries associated with a battery material entry. Overall Battery Material Properties \u00b6 The overall battery materials properties display aggregate or average properties derived from all states of charge (e.g. intercalation levels) for a given structural framework. Note that some intercalation levels presented in this section may be outside the desired range of voltage, stability, or safety. More details are given in the 'Voltage pair properties' section. Voltage Pair Properties \u00b6 This table displays calculated data for each voltage step along the voltage profile. In each row, the two material entries associated with a single voltage step and the corresponding properties (volume change, capacity, voltage, etc.) are displayed. Click on the composition of one of the materials listed to be directed to that material entry.

This page describes how to develop your own applications using the data and software of the Materials Project. Programming language \u00b6 Although you can use any programming language to develop applications, we recommend the Python programming language (version 3.0 or newer). Python is the language of the Materials Project codebases, is widely used and supported by the scientific community, and allows for rapid development. If you choose not to use Python, we suggest a language with good JSON parsing support (JSON is the data exchange format of the Materials Project). In addition, we suggest a language that can easily make requests to web servers and fetch responses as JSON. Programming environment \u00b6 If you are programming in Python, we suggest using a Python IDE such as PyCharm (commercial) or Eclipse+PyDev (free). However, some people prefer to use a UNIX-style text editor such as vi or emacs. Getting and analyzing data using pymatgen \u00b6 The Materials Project provides an open-source Python code, pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics), that can be used to: Access Materials Project data Convert data between several file formats Perform materials analyses Set up calculations The pymatgen documentation provides many examples on how to perform common tasks. For example, this gist by Shyue Ping Ong demonstrates how to generate phase diagrams dynamically using Materials Project data, as well as check a new material's stability with respect to decomposition. To get started with pymatgen, we suggest you visit the official pymatgen documentation . Accessing Materials Project data from any program \u00b6 With the Materials API, you can get Materials Project data from any program that can perform a GET request to our server.

Interfacial reactions can occur when two contacting materials are not thermodynamically stable against each other. Information about interface reactions is valuable in various aspects: the reaction energy reflects the reactivity of the interface, and the reaction products affect the performance of devices such as Li-ion batteries that are built from these materials. Experimental investigation of interface reactions is challenging as accessing the interface between two solids is difficult and the reaction layers have only limited thickness. It is thus highly valuable to predict possible interface reactions from a computational approach. Materials Project database provides calculated energies of a wide range of materials. By using all compounds in the relevant chemical system from Materials Project database, one can construct the reaction energy plots for the interface systems at 0 K and 0 atm. The Manual outlines the usage of the Interface Reactions App and the computational methods employed. Using the Interface Reactions App \u00b6 To construct the reaction energy plot for a closed system, enter the two reactants in contact into the fields \u201cReactant 1\u201d and \"Reactant 2\" and click on \u201cCompute\u201d button. In the case where the interface system is open to a particular element at a constant chemical potential (e.g., solid-state synthesis under constant \\(O_2\\) gas flow), after entering the reactants, click on \"Advanced options\", and then check the \"Open element?\" box, select the element from the drop-down list, and enter the desired relative chemical potential. Note that the relative chemical potential of an element is referenced to the chemical potential of pure substance of that element. For example, for element Li the reference chemical potential is that of Li metal. Users can also use the slider bar to change the chemical potential for gaseous phases. For gaseous phases such as \\(O_2\\) , increasing temperature and/or decreasing the pressure leads to a lower chemical potential of the element. As the plot is generated, it shows the reactivity (normalized reaction energy) of the interface as a function of molar fraction \\(x\\) of the first reactant. There are multiple ways to get the reaction information: When mousing over a node on the plot, the pop-up window shows the reactivity (eV/atom) and the reaction equation. You can zoom into a portion of the plot by defining a zoom area: click and hold at the upper-left corner of the desired area, and drag down and right, releasing the mouse at the lower-right corner of the desired area. The window should be replaced by the zoomed-in portion. To return to the original phase diagram, click on the \u201cAutoscale\u201d button in the tool bar at the upper-right corner. The reaction energy plot can be downloaded in PNG format by clicking on the first button in the tool bar at the upper-right corner. The table below the plot shows the detailed information of the reactions at critical molar fractions. Interpreting Reaction Energy Plots \u00b6 The section shows how to interpret reaction energy plot generated by the Interface Reactions App. In the table below the plot, you can review, for each node in the plot, the corresponding quantities: mol fraction : The molar fraction of the first input reactant reactivity (eV/atom) : The reaction energy normalized to the total number of atoms in reactants. (For an open system, the element in the reservoir is excluded for the normalization.) reaction equation : A reaction equation chosen to normalize one of the reactants. reaction energy (kJ/mol) : The reaction energy (per mol) of the displayed reaction equation. All input reactants are converted to reduced cell formulae in reaction equations. For example, the reactant \\(Li_2Co_2O_4\\) will be converted to \\(LiCoO_2\\) . Reaction Plots in Closed Systems \u00b6 Figure 1. Calculated reaction energy plot for LiCoO2-Li3PS4 closed system To illustrate the reaction information generated by the Interface Reactions App, we use \\(LiCoO_2-Li_3PS_4\\) system as an example. \\(LiCoO_2\\) and \\(Li_3PS_4\\) are commonly used cathode material and solid-state electrolyte material in Li-ion batteries, respectively. The cathode/electrolyte interface is of particular interest in battery research as it largely affects the battery performance. Figure 1 shows the reactivity as a function of molar fraction \\(x\\) of \\(LiCoO_2\\) . Table 1 lists all the critical reaction equations, corresponding molar fraction of the first reactant and reaction energies per mole of reaction equation. There are 8 nodes in Figure 1 corresponding to 8 critical reactions. For example, the second node from the left with molar fraction of \\(LiCoO_2\\) being 0.667 corresponds to the reaction: \\[Li_3PS_4 + 2 LiCoO_2 = 0.5 CoS_2 + 0.5 Co_3S_4 + Li_3PO_4 + Li_2S\\] The reactivity for this node is -0.399 eV/atom. The reaction energy of the reaction above is -616.0 kJ/mol. The largest reaction driving force (magnitude of reactivity) is found for two reactions with the molar fraction of \\(LiCoO_2\\) being 0.686 and 0.742, respectively. The corresponding reactivity is -0.402 eV/atom. Table 1. Critical reaction information for LiCoO2-Li3PS4 closed system Since in reality the reaction between two phases can consume arbitrary amounts of either phase, the molar fraction in the mixed region is not necessarily the critical molar fraction in Table 1, but can be any value from 0 to 1. If the molar fraction is not exactly equal to the critical fraction, the reaction is a linear combination of the critical reactions for its left neighbor node and right neighbor node, by the lever rule. As a consequence, all reaction products in Table 1 are possible phases that may be generated at the interface. Reaction Plots in Open Systems \u00b6 Figure 2. Calculated reaction energy plot for LiCoO2-Li3PS4 system open to Li reservoir at relative chemical potential - 3 eV vs. Li metal. Table 2. Critical reaction information for LiCoO2-Li3PS4 system open to Li reservoir at relative chemical potential - 3 eV vs. Li metal. We use the \\(LiCoO_2-Li_3PS_4\\) system that opens to Li reservoir to illustrate the reaction energy plot for an open system. The Li reservoir is at relative chemical potential - 3 eV vs. Li metal, corresponding to \u03bc = -3 eV in the App. In Figure 2, there are 16 labeled nodes that corresponds to 16 critical reactions. The reaction energy at \\(x\\) = 0 is negative, meaning that \\(Li_3PS_4\\) is not stable at the given Li chemical potential. The corresponding decomposition reaction is: \\[Li_3PS_4 = 2.875 Li + 0.5 P_2S_7 + 0.125 LiS_4\\] The reaction equation shows that Li is extracted from the reactants to the Li reservoir during the decomposition of \\(Li_3PS_4\\) . In contrast, \\(LiCoO_2\\) is stable at the given Li chemical potential as the reactivity is 0 eV/atom at \\(x\\) = 1. The interpretation of other reactions in Table 2 is similar to those in the closed system. By comparing Table 1 and Table 2, it can be seen that the reaction products in the closed system and the open system for the same interface are quite different. This is because the stable materials in the closed system are not necessarily stable in the open system. Users can refer to Phase Diagram App to explore the phase diagrams of the corresponding systems. Thermodynamic Methodology \u00b6 The Interface Reactions App uses the computed energies of materials from the Materials Project database. The computational methodology, default total energy corrections and accuracy can be found in the Calculations Guide . We consider two conditions for interface systems where chemical mixing occurs: 1) interfaces that are closed to any element (closed system), and 2) interfaces that are open to a particular element in the chemical system (open system). These two scenarios are treated separately as below: Chemical Mixing in Closed Systems \u00b6 For closed systems, we calculate the reaction energy of two reactants A and B at varying mixing fraction \\(x\\) of the first reactant using the equation: \\[\\Delta E[A, B, x] = E_{pd} [x c_A + (1 - x) c_B] - x E_A - (1 - x) E_B\\] where \\(c_A\\) and \\(c_B\\) are the normalized compositions (i.e., the total number of atoms = 1) for reactants A and B, \\(E_A\\) and \\(E_B\\) are energies of ground-state structures for reactants A and B, respectively. \\(E_{pd}[c]\\) is the energy on the energy convex hull at composition \\(c\\) . In the case where there is no structure in the database that matches the composition of reactant A or B, the energy on the convex hull \\(E_{pd}[c_A]\\) or \\(E_{pd}[c_B]\\) for that composition will be used instead. It should be noted that at endpoints (x = 0 or 1), the reaction energies can be zero or negative, depending on whether the ground-state structure energy of reactant A or B is on the hull or above the hull. In the generated reaction energy plot and the table, the App converts the mixing fraction \\(x\\) to the corresponding molar fraction of the original first reactant for display. Chemical Mixing in Open Systems \u00b6 In many applications, interface systems are open to a particular element at a constant chemical potential. For example, in battery conditions, the electrode/electrolyte interface is open to Li reservoir during battery cycling. The relevant thermodynamic potential for an open system is the grand potential \u03a6. For instance, for a system open to a Li reservoir at chemical potential \\(\\mu_{Li}\\) , the grand potential for reactant with composition \\(c\\) is obtained using the equation: $\\Phi[c, \\mu_{Li}] = (E[c] - n*{Li}[c] \\mu*{Li})/n_{non-Li}[c] $ where \\(E[c]\\) is the energy of the ground-state structure that has composition \\(c\\) . \\(n_{Li}[c]\\) and \\(n_{non-Li}[c]\\) are the number of Li and non-Li atoms in composition formula \\(c\\) , respectively. PV and TS terms are ignored when calculating \u03a6. Because the system is open to Li, the grand potential is normalized by the number of non-Li atoms. The convex hull of \\(\\Phi\\) is constructed using the grand potentials of all phases in the chemical system. As a result, the grand potential on the grand potential convex hull \\(\\Phi_{pd}\\) is a function of composition \\(c\\) and chemical potential \\(\\mu_{Li}\\) of the reservoir: \\[\\Phi_{pd}[c, \\mu_{Li}] = \\min_{c_{Li}}{\\{(E_{pd}[c+c_{Li}] - n_{Li}[c+c_{Li}] \\mu_{Li}) / n_{non-Li}[c]\\}}\\] where \\(c_{Li}\\) is the number of Li atoms extracted from or added to the Li reservoir and therefore can take positive or negative value. The reaction energy is calculated using: \\[\\Delta \\Phi[A, B, \\mu_{Li}, x] = \\Phi_{pd}[xc_A + (1 - x) c_B, \\mu_{Li}] - x \\Phi[c_A, \\mu_{Li}] - (1 - x) \\Phi[c_B, \\mu_{Li}]\\] Since the Interface Reactions App is based on the analysis of the energy convex hull, compounds that are metastable at 0 K will not show up in the reaction products, although they might be stable or kinetically stabilized under experimental conditions. Therefore, reactions not listed in the table are possible to happen under experimental conditions. Citing \u00b6 To cite the Interface Reactions App, please reference the following work: Note that the methodology used in this paper is slightly different from the one employed in the Interface Reactions App. In the paper, the energies for reactants are always the energies on the convex hull at the compositions of reactants, whereas in the Interface Reactions App the default reactant energies are the energies of corresponding ground-state structures. Only when no structure in the database matches the reactant composition will the energy on the convex hull be used. Users can restore the methodology used in the paper by additionally checking the \"Always use hull energies?\" box in the \"Advanced options\".

The reaction energy at \\(x\\) = 0 is negative, meaning that \\(Li_3PS_4\\) is not stable at the given Li chemical potential. The corresponding decomposition reaction is: \\[Li_3PS_4 = 2.875 Li + 0.5 P_2S_7 + 0.125 LiS_4\\] The reaction equation shows that Li is extracted from the reactants to the Li reservoir during the decomposition of \\(Li_3PS_4\\) . In contrast, \\(LiCoO_2\\) is stable at the given Li chemical potential as the reactivity is 0 eV/atom at \\(x\\) = 1. The interpretation of other reactions in Table 2 is similar to those in the closed system. By comparing Table 1 and Table 2, it can be seen that the reaction products in the closed system and the open system for the same interface are quite different. This is because the stable materials in the closed system are not necessarily stable in the open system. Users can refer to Phase Diagram App to explore the phase diagrams of the corresponding systems.","title":"Reaction Plots in Open Systems"},{"location":"user-guide/interface-reactions/#thermodynamic-methodology","text":"The Interface Reactions App uses the computed energies of materials from the Materials Project database. The computational methodology, default total energy corrections and accuracy can be found in the Calculations Guide . We consider two conditions for interface systems where chemical mixing occurs: 1) interfaces that are closed to any element (closed system), and 2) interfaces that are open to a particular element in the chemical system (open system). These two scenarios are treated separately as below:","title":"Thermodynamic Methodology"},{"location":"user-guide/interface-reactions/#chemical-mixing-in-closed-systems","text":"For closed systems, we calculate the reaction energy of two reactants A and B at varying mixing fraction \\(x\\) of the first reactant using the equation: \\[\\Delta E[A, B, x] = E_{pd} [x c_A + (1 - x) c_B] - x E_A - (1 - x) E_B\\] where \\(c_A\\) and \\(c_B\\) are the normalized compositions (i.e., the total number of atoms = 1) for reactants A and B, \\(E_A\\) and \\(E_B\\) are energies of ground-state structures for reactants A and B, respectively. \\(E_{pd}[c]\\) is the energy on the energy convex hull at composition \\(c\\) . In the case where there is no structure in the database that matches the composition of reactant A or B, the energy on the convex hull \\(E_{pd}[c_A]\\) or \\(E_{pd}[c_B]\\) for that composition will be used instead. It should be noted that at endpoints (x = 0 or 1), the reaction energies can be zero or negative, depending on whether the ground-state structure energy of reactant A or B is on the hull or above the hull. In the generated reaction energy plot and the table, the App converts the mixing fraction \\(x\\) to the corresponding molar fraction of the original first reactant for display.","title":"Chemical Mixing in Closed Systems"},{"location":"user-guide/interface-reactions/#chemical-mixing-in-open-systems","text":"In many applications, interface systems are open to a particular element at a constant chemical potential. For example, in battery conditions, the electrode/electrolyte interface is open to Li reservoir during battery cycling. The relevant thermodynamic potential for an open system is the grand potential \u03a6. For instance, for a system open to a Li reservoir at chemical potential \\(\\mu_{Li}\\) , the grand potential for reactant with composition \\(c\\) is obtained using the equation: $\\Phi[c, \\mu_{Li}] = (E[c] - n*{Li}[c] \\mu*{Li})/n_{non-Li}[c] $ where \\(E[c]\\) is the energy of the ground-state structure that has composition \\(c\\) . \\(n_{Li}[c]\\) and \\(n_{non-Li}[c]\\) are the number of Li and non-Li atoms in composition formula \\(c\\) , respectively. PV and TS terms are ignored when calculating \u03a6. Because the system is open to Li, the grand potential is normalized by the number of non-Li atoms. The convex hull of \\(\\Phi\\) is constructed using the grand potentials of all phases in the chemical system. As a result, the grand potential on the grand potential convex hull \\(\\Phi_{pd}\\) is a function of composition \\(c\\) and chemical potential \\(\\mu_{Li}\\) of the reservoir: \\[\\Phi_{pd}[c, \\mu_{Li}] = \\min_{c_{Li}}{\\{(E_{pd}[c+c_{Li}] - n_{Li}[c+c_{Li}] \\mu_{Li}) / n_{non-Li}[c]\\}}\\] where \\(c_{Li}\\) is the number of Li atoms extracted from or added to the Li reservoir and therefore can take positive or negative value. The reaction energy is calculated using: \\[\\Delta \\Phi[A, B, \\mu_{Li}, x] = \\Phi_{pd}[xc_A + (1 - x) c_B, \\mu_{Li}] - x \\Phi[c_A, \\mu_{Li}] - (1 - x) \\Phi[c_B, \\mu_{Li}]\\] Since the Interface Reactions App is based on the analysis of the energy convex hull, compounds that are metastable at 0 K will not show up in the reaction products, although they might be stable or kinetically stabilized under experimental conditions.

Introduction \u00b6 The primary goal of the molecular explorer is to report the atomic structure of molecules, found using quantum chemistry computational methods. Further quantities of interest, including the electron affinity (EA) and ionization energies (IE), are also reported. Manual \u00b6 Molecular Glossary of Terms Calculations \u00b6 Atomic structures and quantities of interest were calculated using the Materials Project infrastructure with the quantum chemistry software Q-Chem at the backend. For small molecules, Q-Chem calculations were performed using the 6-31+G* Pople bases 1 and the hybrid-functional B3LYP 2 . For molecules with more than 50 atoms, a hybrid procedure 3 was used in which the geometry is optimized at a low level of theory and quantities of interest are still calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G* level as a single point calculation. Geometry Optimization \u00b6 An atomic structure is stable if its vibrational frequency spectrum contains no imaginary frequencies. Thus, the atomic structures were calculated using a dynamic workflow that performs successive calculations until a geometry with zero imaginary frequencies is obtained 3 . Properties \u00b6 The electron affinity (EA) and ionization potential (IP) are given by \\( \\(EA = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{red}(sol)}{nF}\\) \\) \\( \\(IP = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{ox}(sol)}{nF}\\) \\) where F is the Faraday constant, and \\(\\Delta G_{ox}(sol)\\) and \\(\\Delta G_{red}(sol)\\) are the Gibbs free energy change of oxidation and reduction in the solution phase, respectively.

This gives rise to a series of unique properties, making nanoporous materials useful for industrially important applications such as gas storage, separations, catalysis, et cetera. A vast number of unique nanoporous materials can be synthesized, varying in chemical composition and pore topology. Thousands such materials have already been synthesized and hundreds of thousand hypothetical materials have been computationally predicted. In addition, a considerable number of computational screening studies have appeared in the literature that examine the potential of nanoporous materials for a series of applications. This has generated a substantial amount of data that cannot be presented efficiently by traditional publications. To address this, the Nanoporous Explorer App provides a platform for the aggregation and presentation of data related to nanoporous materials and their properties in an interactive way. The app aims to ease the access to the available information in a way that was not previously possible and enable the identification of promising materials based on their performance and properties. The data for the Nanoporous Explorer App are predicted, measured, and/or maintained by the Nanoporous Materials Genome Center (NMGC). This manual covers the description of the classes of materials and type of properties currently available. Using the Nanoporous Explorer App \u00b6 The search interface of the Nanoporous Explorer App is built around an interactive 2-dimensional scatter plot. In order to initiate a search and generate a scatter plot, you need to select one or more of the available material and adsorbate classes from the drop down menu at the top of the screen and hit the \u201cExplore Nanoporous Materials\u201d button. The default selection includes all the available material classes and no adsorbates. Interfacing with the data \u00b6 Once a scatter plot has been generated, for a set of material and adsorbate classes, you can click and drag the mouse cursor on the plot to zoom in on a specific area. When zoomed in, a \u201creset zoom\u201d button will appear to go back to the default plot size. The sliders on the right of the screen can adjust the pressure and temperature range of the data. You can click on a point in the scatter plot to access a list of materials in the vicinity of the chosen point. The materials close to the chosen point will appear as a table below the scatter plot, and you can obtain detailed information about the material by clicking on each material in the table. The details page for each material provides all the properties available for this specific material. Such details include pore characteristics and material properties for all the materials as well as adsorption properties (Henry\u2019s constants, adsorption isotherms and the heats of adsorption) for a subset of the materials. Material Classes \u00b6 CoRE MOFs \u00b6 Computation-Ready, Experimental MOF database was constructed by a collaboration within the Nanoporous Materials Genome Center. The database is derived from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), which contains a large number of small organic and inorganic molecules as well as periodic structures. After the construction of the database, a large-scale GCMC simulation was carried out on all the structures in the database for methane storage and working capacity 1 . Key Assumptions in Creating the CoRE MOF Database \u00b6 Stoichiometry information provided by the CSD is correct. Crystal structures were categorized and processed based on the stoichiometry text information provided by the CSD. If the stoichiometry string for a given structure did not contain commas, we assumed that the structure does not contain additional species (solvents or ions) apart from the MOF framework. If the stoichiometry string did not contain \"+\" or \"-\" signs, we assumed that the structure does not contain ionic species. The disorder information provided by the CSD gives complete information about the presence of disorder in the crystal structure. We assume that the structures without such text do not contain any disorder and represent the pristine crystal structure as reported in the literature. Database Construction Procedure \u00b6 Four steps were taken to extract the crystal structures from the CSD and make them computation-ready: Removal of free solvents and coordinated solvents. Judicious retention of charge-balancing ions in the framework atoms to make the crystal charge neutral. Text Mining to recover structures with no framework disorder. Manual editing of any disordered structures. Graph-based representation of Molecular Structures \u00b6 Solvent removal and ion retention procedures rely on the construction of molecular graph representation of a MOF crystal. To construct the periodic adjacency matrix for each structure the Atomic Simulation Environment NeighborList module is used. Two atoms are considered bonded if the distance between them is less than the sum of their CSD covalent radii plus a skin distance of 0.3 \u00c5. The skin distance is chosen to be slightly smaller than the CSD definition (0.4 \u00c5) such that the terminal atom connected to the metal atom does not form another bond with other nearby atoms. The adjacency matrix is passed to the SciPy connected components module to identify the bonded components in each structure. Removal of Free Solvents and Coordinated Solvents \u00b6 All bonded components in the molecular graph of each structure other than the MOF framework and charge-balancing ions were removed. The MOF framework was defined as the highest molecular weight bonded component of the graph. Interpenetrated MOF frameworks were retained by identifying the number of atoms, N, in the largest bonded component in the structure and retaining all additional components having at least 0.5N atoms. The bonded component corresponding to the MOF framework often includes undesirable solvent bound to unsaturated metal centers. To remove these coordinated solvent molecules, we performed a trial \u201ccut\u201d on all bonds between metal centers oxygen atoms. If the number of bonded clusters detected by the connected component algorithm remained constant, the bond was restored. If the number of bonded components increased, the entire new component was considered a solvent molecule and removed. An exception was built into the algorithm to retain hydroxyl groups bonded to metal centers. Retention of Charge-Balancing Ions \u00b6 Many MOF structures with associated charge-balancing ions also contain undesirable neutral solvent molecules. To discriminate between ionic species and neutral solvent molecules, the elemental compositions of the bonded components in a molecular graph of each structure were compared to the chemical formulas reported by the CSD using an in-house python script. The bonded components are the independent \u201cmolecules\u201d within each structure; these include the MOF framework, the ionic species, and any neutral solvent molecules. The bonded components with elemental compositions matching the composition of the ions reported by the CSD were exempted from deletion in the solvent removal step. Hypothetical MOFs \u00b6 Wilmer and co-workers at Northwestern University have created a database of 137,953 hypothetical Metal-organic frameworks 2 . Current analysis of this database includes Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to estimate the methane storage and working capacity of MOFs using Universal Force Field parameters (UFF). Among the top 300 hypothetical MOFs, Wilmer and co-workers identified target materials for synthesis and measured gas adsorption characteristics and found that excellent agreement between simulation and experiment. The hypothetical MOF database has also been used to define the structure-property relationship for \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) and \\(\\ce{N2}\\) separation 3 , Xe/Kr separation 4 5 , and hydrogen storage applications 6 . Building Blocks \u00b6 A novel, bottom-up algorithm was developed to speed up structure enumeration. One hundred and two building blocks with varying degree of geometry and number of acids sites (e.g., COOH- sites) were used. The building blocks are divided into three main groups: metal nodes, organic linkers, and functional groups. Table 1 and Figure 1 summarizes the building blocks used in structure generation algorithm for Ref. 1 . To make the hypothetical MOF database relevant for hydrogen storage, only magnesium atoms were incorporated into the linker as a functional group, and new types of linkers were used as building blocks. The two hydrogen atoms on the phenyl ring group were substituted with two oxygen atoms and one magnesium atom. For each MOF structure, 0%, 50% and 100% magnesium functionalization was used. The list of building blocks and functionalization scheme is shown in Figure 2. Generation Algorithms \u00b6 The generation procedure creates hypothetical MOFs by recombining building blocks derived from crystallographic data of already synthesized MOFs. Atoms are grouped into building blocks based on reagents used in reported synthesis procedures as shown in Table 1. A building block can be combined with any other building block provided that the local geometry and chemical composition are the same as in crystallographically determined structure. Building blocks are combined in a piece-wise manner. When atomic overlap occurs at a particular step, a different building block or connection site is chosen until all possibilities are exhausted. Note that there is no force field (or quantum mechanical) energy minimizations involved; the pieces are connected according to geometric rules that govern how the building blocks are connected in already synthesized MOFs. Figure 2 summarizes the generation step discussed above. Hypothetical Zeolites \u00b6 Zeolites are crystalline nanoporous material made from tetrahedrally coordinated silicon or aluminum atoms connected by oxygen atoms. Zeolites are naturally occurring, but are usually produced synthetically for industrial applications in adsorption and catalysis. The International Zeolite Association database lists 218 siliceous zeolite structures that have been synthesized in the laboratory 6. Synthesis of new zeolite structures is an active area of research. Deem et al. generated a large database of hypothetical silica zeolite structures that could serve as targets for experimental synthesis 7 , 8 . First, graphs of possible framework were enumerated by placing tetrahedral nodes (\u201cT-atoms\u201d) in all 230 symmetry groups over a wide range of lattice constants. These candidate structure were then annealed with the Sander-Leslie-Catlow interatomic potential to yield over 300,000 structures within 30 kJ mol-1 of quartz. Other Hypothetical Materials \u00b6 In addition to MOFs and Zeolites currently a set of 10,000 computational predicted porous polymeric networks (PPNs) are available 9 . Properties \u00b6 Henry's Constants \u00b6 The Henry's constant ( \\(K_H\\) ), expressed in mol/kg/bar for gas phase system, defines the slope on the adsorption isotherm at the low-pressure limit. Computational calculation of Henry's constant can be efficiently carried out using Widom\u2019s ghost particle insertion 10 method over the simulation cell volume and calculating the energy difference of the system with the sorbate molecule in the nanoporous material (adsorbed phase) and with the sorbate molecule in the surrounding fluid phase. The Henry's constant is related to the energy difference for the molecule in the simulation cell by, \\( \\(K_H={M\\over8{\\pi}V{\\rho}RT}{\\int}e^{-{\\beta}U}dr={1\\over{RT}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{points}}{\\exp(-{\\beta}U_{i}^{ads})}\\over{N_{points}}}\\) \\) Eq. 1 The obtained Henry\u2019s constant can be used to calculate the free energy of adsorption in the infinite-dilution limit of the sorbate molecule via the following thermodynamic relationship (Equation 2): \\( \\(A_{ads}=-RT\\text{ln}(RT{\\rho}_sK_H)\\) \\) Eq.2 Application to Large-scale screening \u00b6 Recently, the ratio of Henry\u2019s constant has been used to rapidly assess the materials selectivity of one molecule over another (e.g., \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) over \\(\\ce{H2}\\) ). Examples of such studies in literature include work by Haldoupis, et. al ( \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) / \\(\\ce{H2}\\) ) 13 and Watanabe, et. al. ( \\(\\ce{CO2}\\) / \\(\\ce{N2}\\) ) 14 . Absorption Isotherms \u00b6 In porous materials, such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous polymer networks (PPNs), adsorption is the physical adsorption of molecules from a gas or liquid phase onto the solid surface, such as pore wall. An adsorption isotherm is the loading of adsorbate as a function of pressure and/or composition at a given temperature in thermodynamic equilibrium. Adsorption isotherms are sometimes normalized by the mass or volume of the adsorbent to allow comparison of the adsorption capacity of different materials. Adsorption isotherms are fundamental in characterizing the suitability of nanoporous materials for gas storage and separation applications. Experimentally measured nitrogen and argon isotherms are used to determine the surface area and pore size distribution of nanoporous materials 15 . The adsorption isotherms can be predicted computationally using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) or Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) techniques. This is useful for efficiently screening large databases of experimentally synthesized and hypothetical constructed nanoporous materials for desirable adsorption properties 1 . The accuracy of the simulations depends on choice of the force fields that describe fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions. Nanoporous Materials Explorer includes GCMC simulation results for methane uptake in each material at a temperature of 298 K and pressures of 5.8, 35, and 65 bar. Heat of Adsorption \u00b6 In two phase gas-liquid systems, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation states that the latent heat of vaporization of a pure component is approximately proportional to the slope of a plot of \\(\\text{ln}(P_{sat})\\) vs. \\(1/T\\) 16 . The analogous expression for two phase systems consists of gas and porous materials defines the isosteric heat of adsorption qst 17 : \\( \\(q_{st}={RT^2}\\left ({{\\partial{\\text{ln}P}}\\over{\\partial{T}}}\\right )_N\\) \\) Eq.3 Therefore, the isosteric heat of adsorption may be obtained by plotting ln P vs T relations from several isotherms at a constant adsorbate loading of N. The heat of adsorption is positive by definition, and the negative heat of adsorption is also known as the differential enthalpy of adsorption. The negative sign reflects the exothermic nature of adsorption. The heat adsorption is a quantitative measure of whether a species is strongly adsorbing or weakly adsorbing, with values typically ranging from 10 to 40 kJ/mol. Heats of adsorption can be determined experimentally by differential calorimetry. In molecular simulations, the isosteric heat of adsorption can be calculated from a fluctuation method 1 : \\( \\(q_{st}={RT}-{{\\langle{VN}\\rangle-\\langle{V}\\rangle\\langle{N}\\rangle}\\over{\\langle{N^2}\\rangle-\\langle{N}\\rangle^2}}\\) \\) Eq.4 Here, \\(V\\) is the potential energy per adsorbate molecule. The angled brackets indicate an ensemble average taken over a grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation at low loading to minimize the influence of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. In the limit of low loading, the heat of adsorption is related to the Henry\u2019s constant by 18 : \\( \\(q_{st}={{\\partial{\\text{ln}K_H}}\\over{\\partial{\\beta}}}\\) \\) Eq.5 Here, \u03b2 is \\(1/(k_BT)\\) where \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant. DDEC Point Charges \u00b6 Partial point charges are provided for a majority of the structures in the CoRE MOF database. These charges were calculated using the Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical (DDEC) method that involves atomic population analysis on the electron and spin density distributions generated by quantum chemistry methods 19 . DDEC charges reproduce atomic chemical states and the electrostatic potential surrounding a material. Such charges are well suited for constructing force fields used in atomistic simulations such as classical molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations. Calculation Details \u00b6 Charges were assignment using the January 2014 version of the DDEC program provided by Manz et.al 20 . The electron and spin density distributions used as input for the DDEC code were generated in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) software 21 . Single point plane wave density functional theory calculations with the PBE functional were performed. While the DDEC method provides an individual charge for each atom in the system, it is computationally more convenient to distinguish between atom types within a structure. Therefore, point charges are provided for each atom type in a structure. Atom types are assigned based on the atom\u2019s neighboring environment and charges for each atom type are averaged to obtain a net neutral system. Pore Descriptors \u00b6 A series of pore descriptors have been proposed in the literature as way of quantifying the unique pore topology present in each material. We have currently collected four such descriptors: Pore Limiting Diameter (PLD): Is defined as the smallest opening along the pore that a molecule needs to cross in order to diffuse through this material. This quantity is also know as the largest free sphere. Reported in units of \u00c5. Largest Cavity Diameter (LCD): Is defined as the largest opening along the pore. This quantity is also known as the largest included sphere. Reported in units of \u00c5. Void Fraction: Is defined as the fraction of the unit cell volume that is accessible to specific molecule. All the values have been so far computed for a \\(\\ce{CH4}\\) molecule using a sphere of radius 1.645 \u00c5. Accessible Surface Area: Is defined as the surface area that a sorbate molecule can access inside the pores of a material. It is computed using the method by D\u00fcren et al. 22 . All the values have been so far computed for a \\(\\ce{CH4}\\) molecule using a sphere of radius 1.645 \u00c5. Reported in units of \\(\\text{m}^2/\\text{cm}^3\\) All the pore descriptors have been calculated using the open source software Zeo++ . Recently, this software was used to generate fingerprints to evaluate similarity of porous structures 23 . P-XRD Patterns \u00b6 Simulated powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns derived from crystallographic data are provided for nanoporous materials. PXRD is a widely used technique for characterizing solid materials. The scattering of X-rays from atoms produces a diffraction pattern, which contains information about the atomic arrangement within the crystal. Therefore, the PXRD pattern can serve as the fingerprint to identify the phase and structure of a solid materials 24 . PXRD pattern of a solid material is commonly recorded using a diffractometer. The results can be used to determine phase composition, unit cell lattice parameters, crystal structure, Texture/Orientation and crystalline size.

A vast number of unique nanoporous materials can be synthesized, varying in chemical composition and pore topology. Thousands such materials have already been synthesized and hundreds of thousand hypothetical materials have been computationally predicted. In addition, a considerable number of computational screening studies have appeared in the literature that examine the potential of nanoporous materials for a series of applications. This has generated a substantial amount of data that cannot be presented efficiently by traditional publications. To address this, the Nanoporous Explorer App provides a platform for the aggregation and presentation of data related to nanoporous materials and their properties in an interactive way. The app aims to ease the access to the available information in a way that was not previously possible and enable the identification of promising materials based on their performance and properties.

An adsorption isotherm is the loading of adsorbate as a function of pressure and/or composition at a given temperature in thermodynamic equilibrium. Adsorption isotherms are sometimes normalized by the mass or volume of the adsorbent to allow comparison of the adsorption capacity of different materials. Adsorption isotherms are fundamental in characterizing the suitability of nanoporous materials for gas storage and separation applications. Experimentally measured nitrogen and argon isotherms are used to determine the surface area and pore size distribution of nanoporous materials 15 . The adsorption isotherms can be predicted computationally using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) or Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) techniques. This is useful for efficiently screening large databases of experimentally synthesized and hypothetical constructed nanoporous materials for desirable adsorption properties 1 .

Manual \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Phase diagrams represent the thermodynamic phase equilibria of multicomponent systems and reveal useful insights into fundamental material aspects regarding the processing and reactions of materials. However, the experimental determination of a phase diagram is an extremely time-consuming process, requiring careful synthesis and characterization of all phases in a chemical system. Computational tools can accelerate phase diagram construction significantly. By calculating the energies of all known compounds in a given chemical system (e.g. \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) ), we can determine the phase diagram for that system at 0 K and 0 atm. Furthermore, for systems comprised of predominantly solid phases open with respect to a gaseous element, approximations can be made as to the finite temperature and pressure phase diagrams. In this manual, we will outline the general usage and thermodynamics methodology of our computational phase diagrams app. The details of the calculations, including computational methodology and accuracy, used in constructing these phase diagrams are available in the Calculations Manual and will not be further covered in this manual. Using the Computational Phase Diagram App \u00b6 To construct the phase diagram of a 2-4 component chemical system (e.g. \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) ), you only need to select the desired elements from the periodic table and click the \"Generate\" button. To generate a grand potential phase diagram, for which one of the components of the phase diagram is considered 'open' to the system, select a projected element from the drop-down list, and input a desired chemical potential either manually or using the temperature slider (for supported elements \\(\\ce{O2}\\) , \\(\\ce{N2}\\) , \\(\\ce{H2}\\) , \\(\\ce{F2}\\) , and \\(\\ce{Cl2}\\) only). When available, the temperature slider has been calibrated using entropy data from NIST. 1 Once the phase diagram has been generated, there are multiple ways to interact with the data: When mousing over nodes in the phase diagram, a pop-up appears that identifies the phase. The pop-up lists both stable and unstable crystal structures computed at that composition. You may click the id link to bring up more details of that compound, such as detailed crystal structure information. Checking the 'Show Unstable' box will display the compositions at which unstable compounds have been computed as blue circles. You can zoom into a portion of the phase diagram by defining a zoom area: click and hold at the upper-left corner of the desired area, and drag down and right, releasing the mouse at the lower-right corner of the desired area. A pop-up with the zoomed-in portion should appear. To return to the original phase diagram, click anywhere outside the pop-up. Interpreting Phase Diagrams \u00b6 This section provides a short guide on interpreting phase diagrams generated by the PDApp. A more comprehensive discussion and example of phase diagram interpretation can be found in References 2 and 3. 2 3 Basic Phase Diagram Information \u00b6 While the PDApp generates several types of phase diagrams, some information is common to all phase diagrams. As an illustrative example, we refer to Figure 1 , a ternary \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) phase diagram at 0 K and 0 atm calculated using the PDApp. Figure 1: Calculated Li-Fe-O Phase Diagram Several pieces of information can be obtained from Figure 1 : The red nodes on the phase diagram represent phases that are calculated to be stable under the given conditions. Blue circles (not shown) represent phases that are calculated to be unstable under the given conditions. An arbitrary composition will thermodynamically decompose to stable phases (red nodes), with the relative proportion of each stable phase determined by the lever rule. Regarding polymorphic compounds (compounds that change crystal structure with respect to temperature or pressure), only limited information can be obtained because phase diagrams generated by the PDApp do not include an explicit temperature axis. For most solid materials, our experience indicates that temperature and pressure contribute fairly small changes to differences in total energy. Thus, we expect that crystal structures for which the PDApp reports similar formation energies (i.e., within about 50 meV/atom) might be candidates for polymorphism. The PDApp models only the thermodynamics of a system. Thus, compounds that are metastable (kinetically stabilized) may not show up as stable on the generated phase diagram. We expect that compounds for which the decomposition energy into stable phases is low are potential candidates for metastability; however, compounds with extremely high decomposition energies into stable phases (i.e., over about 200 meV/atom) are less likely to be metastable. The thermodynamic scale of inorganic crystalline metastability is discussed in Reference 4. 4 Compositional Phase Diagrams \u00b6 In a compositional phase diagram, the system is closed with respect to the environment. We display compositional phase diagrams involving different numbers of components in slightly different ways. Binary Compositional Phase Diagrams \u00b6 Figure 2 is an example of a calculated binary \\(\\ce{Fe-P}\\) phase diagram at 0 K and 0 atm using the PDApp. Binary phase diagrams show the complete convex hull for the system, where the y-axis is the formation energy per atom and the x-axis is the composition (e.g. in the \\(\\ce{Fe-P}\\) phase diagram, the x-axis is the fraction of \\(\\ce{P}\\) ). Figure 2: Calculated Fe-P Phase Diagram The black lines show the convex hull construction, which connects stable phases. Unstable phases will always appear above the convex hull line; one measure of the thermodynamic stability of an arbitrary compound is its distance from the convex hull line, which predicts the decomposition energy of that phase into the most stable phases. Ternary Compositional Phase Diagrams \u00b6 Figure 1 is an example of a calculated ternary \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) phase diagram at 0 K and 0 atm using the PDApp. The presentation of ternary phase diagrams differs from that of binary phase diagrams; the energy axis is removed so that the entire compositional space can be represented. (The energy axis, not shown, can be thought of as coming 'out of the page'). The black lines in the ternary phase diagrams are projections of the convex hull construction into compositional space. The lines form Gibbs triangles, which can be used to find stable phases at an arbitrary composition. At any point in the phase diagram other than the stable nodes, the equilibrium phases are given by vertices of the triangle bounding that composition. For example, the equilibrium phases for a composition with \\(\\ce{Li:Fe:O}\\) ratio of 1:1:1 (i.e., in the center of the phase diagram), is predicted to be \\(\\ce{Li5FeO4}\\) , \\(\\ce{LiFeO2}\\) and \\(\\ce{Fe}\\) . Quaternary Compositional Phase Diagrams \u00b6 Quaternary phase diagrams are presented in the same general way as ternary phase diagrams, but an additional axis is needed to represent the fourth composition. Therefore, quaternary phase diagrams are shown in three dimensions rather than as a 2D plot. The lines in quaternary phase diagrams define polyhedra with 4 vertices each rather than triangles. At any point in the phase diagram other than the stable nodes, the equilibrium phases are given by the vertices of the polyhedron bounding that composition. Grand Potential Phase Diagrams \u00b6 Grand potential phase diagrams are phase diagrams representing phase equilibria that are open to a particular element. In these phase diagrams, the chemical potential of an element is an external input variable that the user must specify. In some cases (e.g. a gaseous element such as oxygen), the chemical potential can be related to temperature and partial pressure via thermodynamic relations and known experimental data. 6 A grand potential phase diagram involving n components is presented in the same way as a compositional phase diagram involving \\(n-1\\) components. Figure 3: Calculated Li-Fe-O grand potential phase diagram at oxygen chemical potential consistent with approximately 700 K and 0 atm. Figure 3 shows the calculated grand potential phase diagram for the \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) system at an oxygen chemical potential consistent with 700 K and 0 atm. The phase diagram provides information on the equilibrium phases under these conditions for any \\(\\ce{Li:Fe}\\) composition (note that the O fraction is controlled by interactions with the environment). For example, we may observe that a compositon with a relatively high Fe ratio (near composition = 1) will comprise \\(\\ce{Fe2O3}\\) and \\(\\ce{LiFeO2}\\) . In addition, by examining the changes in the equilibrium phases as the chemical potential changes, we can obtain insights into how the phase equilibria are modified with changes in the chemical potential. A detailed discussion of this application can be found in References 2 and 3. 2 3 Accuracy of Calculated Phase Diagrams \u00b6 Figure 4: Experimental Li-Fe-O Phase Diagram Figure 4 shows the experimentally determined phase diagram for the \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) system at 673K. 5 Even though the experimental phase diagram is at a much higher temperature, we can see that our calculated phase diagram reproduces the features very well. The phases \\(\\ce{Li2O}\\) , \\(\\ce{Fe3O4}\\) , \\(\\ce{Fe2O3}\\) , \\(\\ce{LiFeO2}\\) , \\(\\ce{Li5FeO4}\\) are stable in both the experimental diagram and our calculated phase diagram. The only additional phase in our calculated diagram is \\(\\ce{FeO}\\) , which is well known to be difficult to obtain in stoichiometric proportion under normal conditions. Our calculations correctly reproduce the \\(\\ce{FeO}\\) formation enthalpy to within experimental accuracy, and our calculated phase diagram is fullly consistent with known experimental thermochemical data along the \\(\\ce{Fe-O}\\) line at 1 atm and 298K. In general, we can expect that compositional phase diagrams comprising of predominantly solid phases to be reproduced fairly well by our calculations. However, it should be noted that there are inherent limitations in accuracy in the DFT calculated energies . Furthermore, our calculated phase diagrams are at 0 K and 0 atm, and differences with non-zero temperature phase diagrams are to be expected. For grand potential phase diagrams, further approximations are made as to the entropic contributions. 2 3 They are therefore expected to be less accurate, but nonetheless provide useful insights on general trends. Thermodynamics Methodology \u00b6 In the remainder of this section, we will use an \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) system to illustrate the methodology without loss of generality. Compositional Phase Diagram Construction \u00b6 To construct a phase diagram, one would need to compare the relative thermodynamic stability of phases belonging to the system using an appropriate free energy model. For an isothermal, isobaric, closed system, the relevant thermodynamic potential is the Gibbs free energy, \\(G\\) , which can be expressed as a Legendre transform of the enthalpy, \\(H\\) , and internal energy, \\(E\\) , as follows: \\[ \\eqalign{G(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O}) &= H(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O}) - TS(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O})\\cr &= \\eqalign{E(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O}) + PV(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O})\\cr - TS(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O}}} \\] where \\(T\\) is the temperature of the system, \\(S\\) is the entropy of the system, \\(P\\) is the pressure of the system, \\(V\\) is the volume of the system, and \\(N_i\\) is the number of atoms of species \\(i\\) in the system. For systems comprising primarily of condensed phases, the \\(PV\\) term can be neglected and at 0K, the expression for \\(G\\) simplifies to just \\(E\\) . Normalizing \\(E\\) with respect to the total number of particles in the system, we obtain \\(\\bar{E}(0,P,x_{Li},x_{Fe},x_O)\\) , where \\(x_i = \\frac{N_i}{N_{Li} + N_{Fe} + N_{O}}\\) . By taking the convex hull 6 of \\(E\\) for all phases belonging to the M-component system and projecting the stable nodes into the \\((M - 1)\\) - dimension composition space, one can obtain the 0 K phase diagram for the closed system at constant pressure. The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set containing the points. For instance, to construct a 0 K, closed \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) system phase diagram, the convex hull is taken on the set of points in \\((\\bar{E},x_{Li},x_{Fe})\\) space with \\(x_O\\) being related to the other composition variables by \\(x_O = 1 - x_{Li} - x_{Fe}\\) . Grand Potential Phase Diagram Construction \u00b6 In many scientific applications, the phase equilibria of interest is not that of a closed system, but rather one which is open to a particular element. For instance, synthesis might be carried out in flowing Argon gas at a particular temperature, which would mean the system is open to gaseous elements such as oxygen. Other experiments may be carried out in air, which essentially serves as an infinite reservoir of atmospheric elements such as oxygen, nitrogen and others. In environments that are open to a particular element (say oxygen), the relevant control variable is the chemical potential of that element, \\(\\mu_{O}\\) . The relevant thermodynamic potential to study phase equilibria in an open system is the grand potential, which is defined as the following for an \\(\\ce{Li-Fe-O}\\) system that is open with respect to oxygen: \\[ \\eqalign{\\phi(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},\\mu_{O}) &= G(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},\\mu_{O}) - \\mu_ON_O(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},\\mu_{O})\\cr &= \\eqalign{E(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},\\mu_{O}) - TS(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},N_{O})\\cr - \\mu_ON_O(T,P,N_{Li},N_{Fe},\\mu_{O})}} \\] where the \\(PV\\) term is again ignored. Normalizing with respect to \\(\\ce{Li-Fe}\\) composition and dropping the explicit expression of the functional dependence of \\(E\\) , \\(S\\) , and \\(N_{O}\\) on the right-hand side henceforth for brevity, we can obtain \\[\\bar{\\phi}(T,P,x_{Li},x_{Fe},\\mu_{O}) = \\frac{E-TS-\\mu_ON_O}{N_{Li} + N_{Fe}}\\] where \\(x_i = \\frac{N_i}{N_{Li}+N_{Fe}}\\) is the fraction of component \\(i\\) in \\(\\ce{Li-Fe}\\) composition space. To formally introduce temperature into ab initio phase stability calculations, one would usually need to take into account all the relevant excitations (e.g. vibrational, configurational, and electronic) that contribute to entropy. However, for systems where phase equilibria changes takes place primarily between solid phases with absorption or loss of as gas, a few simplifying assumptions can be made that allow us to obtain a useful approximate phase diagram with less effort. In such reactions, the reaction entropy is dominated by the entropy of the gas, and the effect of temperature is mostly captured by changes in the chemical potential of the gas. Since the \\(TS\\) term is the entropy contribution of the condensed system, it can be neglected compared to the entropy effect of the gas, and the expression for \\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) simplifies to: \\[\\bar{\\phi} = \\frac{E-\\mu_ON_O}{N_{Li} + N_{Fe}}\\] Using the above assumption, the effect of temperature and partial pressure can be fully captured in a single chemical potential variable, with a more negative value corresponding to higher temperatures or lower partial pressures. The chemical potential is then treated as an external variable to obtain a grand potential phase diagram under a particular condition by taking the convex hull of \\(\\bar{\\phi}\\) for all phases and projecting the stable nodes into the \\(\\ce{Li-Fe}\\) composition space.

Blue circles (not shown) represent phases that are calculated to be unstable under the given conditions. An arbitrary composition will thermodynamically decompose to stable phases (red nodes), with the relative proportion of each stable phase determined by the lever rule.

For most solid materials, our experience indicates that temperature and pressure contribute fairly small changes to differences in total energy. Thus, we expect that crystal structures for which the PDApp reports similar formation energies (i.e., within about 50 meV/atom) might be candidates for polymorphism. The PDApp models only the thermodynamics of a system. Thus, compounds that are metastable (kinetically stabilized) may not show up as stable on the generated phase diagram. We expect that compounds for which the decomposition energy into stable phases is low are potential candidates for metastability; however, compounds with extremely high decomposition energies into stable phases (i.e., over about 200 meV/atom) are less likely to be metastable.

It is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional free energy-pH-potential diagram. In other words, it shows water-stable phases as a function of pH and potential, where, potential is defined with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. Experimentally determining Pourbaix Diagrams is painstaking work, as we need not only the free energy of aqueous ions, but also that of all solid phases that a system can exist in. The Materials Project offers a very convenient and powerful database of materials properties which has been used to generate Pourbaix diagrams in a high-throughput manner. This manual outlines the usage of the Pourbaix App to calculate Pourbaix diagrams, and the thermodynamic formalism underlying the app. Thermodynamic Formalism of Pourbaix Diagrams \u00b6 To calculate a Pourbaix diagram, free energies of the solid phases, and of the aqueous ions is required. Calculating free energies of ions is tricky, and time-consuming. To overcome this problem, a methodology utilizing experimentally measured free energies of aqueous ions and the calculated DFT energies for solid phases available in the Materials Project was developed. 1 Note that the correction scheme described below is applied over and above any compatibilities/corrections which are applied to the species. Referencing Energies of Aqueous Ions \u00b6 Briefly, for each ion, a reference solid is chosen, and the correction term is calculated for the ion as the energy difference between the experimental and the DFT calculated energies of the reference solid. The basic idea behind this scheme is that, if we have a reference energy for an aqueous ion which reproduces the correct dissolution for one solid, then accurate DFT solid-solid energy differences ensure that all other solids dissolve accurately with respect to that ion. The better the solid is represented by DFT, the more transferable the reference aqueous energy becomes. We therefore prefer to choose simple chemical systems (primarily binaries with an uncomplicated electronic structure) as representative solids. For an aqueous ion i at standard state conditions (e.g., room temperature, atmospheric pressure, and \\(10^{-6}\\) M concentration) using a representative solid s, we define the chemical potential as: Figure 1: Schematic to reference experimental aqueous ion energies to DFT data \\[ \\begin{align} \\mu_{i(aq)}^0 &= \\mu_{i(aq)}^{0,{\\rm exp}} + \\left[\\Delta g_s^{0,{\\rm DFT}} - \\Delta g_s^{0,{\\rm exp}}\\right] \\ & = \\mu_{i(aq)}^{0,{\\rm exp}} + \\Delta\\mu_s^{0, {\\rm DFT - exp}} \\end{align} \\] Figure 1 shows this schematically. Correction for Water \u00b6 In an aqueous environment, many chemical and electrochemical reactions are enabled by the breakdown, formation, or incorporation of water molecules. It is therefore important that the free energy of formation of water is captured accurately. This is known accurately from experiments as \\(-2.46~eV\\) . So, at standard state, the free energy of formation of water is set as follows: \\[ \\begin{align} \\mu^0_{{\\rm H_2O}} &= \\Delta g^{0, {\\rm exp}}_{\\rm H_2O} \\ & = -2.46 eV \\end{align} \\] Correction for Elemental Gaseous, and Liquid States, except \\(\\ce{H2}\\) \u00b6 For all gaseous elements, the experimentally determined entropic contribution at 298 K is added to the DFT/corrected energy of the element as follows: \\[\\mu_i^{\\rm ref} = E_i^{0, {\\rm DFT}} + \\Delta E_i^{\\rm correction} - Ts_i^{\\rm exp}\\] This is implemented for the following elements: \\(\\ce{O_2, F_2, Cl_2, Br_2, Hg}\\) Correction for \\(\\ce{H_2}\\) \u00b6 In an aqueous environment, \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) and \\(\\ce{H_2}\\) in their gaseous states are in equilibrium with water through the reaction \\(\\ce{H2(g) + 1/2O2(g) <-> H2O(l)}\\) Hence, the hydrogen energy is corrected such that the experimental free energy of formation of \\(\\ce{H_2O}\\) is reproduced. \\[ \\begin{align} \\mu_{\\rm H}^{\\rm ref} & = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[g_{\\rm H_2O}^0 - \\mu_O^0 - \\Delta g_{\\rm H_2O}^{0, {\\rm exp}} \\right] \\ & \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ E_{\\rm H_2O}^{0, {\\rm DFT}} -Ts_{\\rm H_2O}^0 - \\mu_O^0 - \\mu_{\\rm H_2O}^{0, {\\rm exp}} \\right] \\end{align} \\] Electrochemical Stability of Metastable Materials \u00b6 In principle, Pourbaix diagrams account for materials only at thermodynamic equilibrium, providing no insight into the electrochemical stability of metastable materials which find practical applications in many commercial applications. However, one can compute the Gibbs free energy difference for an arbitrary material with respect to the Pourbaix stable domains as a function of pH and E, providing an electrochemical (in)stability map for this material. For detailed information on the formalism and its applications see reference 2. 2 Using the Computational Pourbaix App \u00b6 The Pourbaix app is capable of plotting elemental, and multi-element Pourbaix diagrams. To construct an Elemental Pourbaix diagram, enter the element of choice, and click on the Generate button. To generate a multi-elemental Pourbaix diagram, choose the desired multiple elements from the periodic table, and click the Generate button. Note that oxygen and hydrogen are included by default, since these elements are always \"open\" in a Pourbaix diagram. For multi-elemental diagrams, sliders are provided to specify a composition of the elements. Note that for each composition, a new Pourbaix diagram is generated from scratch. To generate electrochemical stability maps of a specific material go to the material's details page and click on the \"Aqueous Stability (Pourbaix)\" tab which can be found in the \"Generate Phase Diagram\" tab. A new tab will open which will show the electrochemical stability map superimposed on a Pourbaix diagram. The ratio of elements used to generate the Pourbaix diagram are same as that of the material in consideration. Electrochemical stability maps are available for materials with up to three non H and O elements. For materials with more than three elements, one can use pymatgen to generate the maps programmatically. Interfacing With the Data \u00b6 To ensure a clutter-free diagram, the domains on the Pourbaix diagram are not labeled by default. To view labels on the plot, select the \"Domain Labels\" check box. Each domain has a mouse-over point located at the center of the domain. Mousing over these points displays the entries corresponding to the domain. Domains which contain a solid in solution are shaded. This helps identify passivation regions, especially in multi-elemental systems, were identifying passivation regions is tricky. Zooming into domains is quite simple! Just drag a selection window using your mouse. To reset zoom, click on the reset zoom button which appears on the upper right corner. Data tables are shown to the right of the Pourbaix diagram. Mousing over rows in the \"Stable\" column of the table highlights the corresponding entries in the Pourbaix diagram. Some stable entries may not get highlighted. This is because the domains corresponding to these entries lies outside the standard limits of the Pourbaix diagram. The \"Unstable\" column in the table lists the unstable entries, and their corresponding energies above hull. Links in the data tables lead to more information about the corresponding entries. Unlinked entries are ions. Mousing over the book icon next to the ions shows the reference for the free energy of formation of the aqueous ion. Demonstration of the Pourbaix App \u00b6 This section briefly demonstrates an elemental Pourbaix diagram, a multi-elemental Pourbaix diagram, and an electrochemical stability map. Elemental Pourbaix Diagram \u00b6 Figure 2 shows the elemental Pourbaix diagram for Fe. The default concentration of ions is \\(10^{-8}\\) M, but can be varied using the \"Concentration\" slider above the diagram. Figure 2: Pourbaix diagram for elemental Fe. The two orange lines are the hydrogen reduction line, and the line denoting water oxidation to \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) . These are clearly labeled in Figure 3. These lines show the stability region of H2O. For example, water is unstable below the \\(\\ce{H_2}\\) line, and so, hydrogen gas evolves at the cathode at conditions below this line. Similarly, above the \\(\\ce{O_2}\\) line, oxygen gas is evolved at the anode. Figure 3: Orange lines are the water oxidation and reduction lines in the Pourbaix diagram. Multi-elemental Pourbaix diagram \u00b6 The stability of multiple-elements in aqueous environments is predicted using multi-elemental Pourbaix diagrams like the one shown in Figure 4. The composition slider bar can be seen above the plot. Here, the small white bar separating the two colors can be clicked on and dragged to change the ratio of Fe to Cr. This may, or may not have any effect on the Pourbaix diagram. More information about how multi-elemental Pourbaix diagrams vary as a function of composition can be found elsewhere. 3 Figure 4: Multi-elemental Fe-Cr Pourbaix diagram at a composition of 18% Cr, 82% Fe. For an n-element diagram, there are n coexisting phases. Note that these can be any mixture of solid, and aqueous phases. So, for the two-element diagram shown in Figure 4, there are two coexisting phases in each domain. As mentioned above, domains shaded blue indicate purely solid domains. For multi-elemental diagrams, shaded domains indicate those in which purely solid phases coexist. Electrochemical Stability Map \u00b6 Figure 5 shows the Gibbs free energy of \\(\\ce{Fe_2O_3}\\) , as a scatter plot, superimposed over the Pourbaix diagram of Fe. For a material with more than one non H and O elements, the ratio of these elements is fixed to the ratio of elements of the material but the concentration of ions can be varied similar to the single- and multi-element Pourbaix diagrams. Figure 5: Electrochemical stability map of Fe2O3 (mp-24972). A colorbar is shown above the electrochemical stability maps. Note that Gibbs free energies larger than 1 eV/atom are not marked in the map. Stable and unstable phase energies can be found in the table to the right of the electrochemical stability map.

It is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional free energy-pH-potential diagram. In other words, it shows water-stable phases as a function of pH and potential, where, potential is defined with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode. Experimentally determining Pourbaix Diagrams is painstaking work, as we need not only the free energy of aqueous ions, but also that of all solid phases that a system can exist in. The Materials Project offers a very convenient and powerful database of materials properties which has been used to generate Pourbaix diagrams in a high-throughput manner.

The better the solid is represented by DFT, the more transferable the reference aqueous energy becomes. We therefore prefer to choose simple chemical systems (primarily binaries with an uncomplicated electronic structure) as representative solids.

The economic viability of non-aqueous and aqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs and AqRFBs respectively) is highly dependent on electroactive materials, salt, and solvent choices. 1 The interactive RFB Dashboard can be used to select redox active materials for use in nonaqueous and aqueous RFBs by displaying individual materials along with regions of economic viability defined by the target battery price and minimum redox active species concentration. 2 In addition, the tool provides concentration targets for redox active materials achieving the target battery price. This tool can be used to analyze both experimentally demonstrated materials and simulated families of materials. Reference 2 describes the techno-economic model implemented in the present tool. The default values of all input parameters are assumed to be the median values presented in Ref. 1. Redox Active Material Design Space \u00b6 Redox active materials are defined using three electrochemical properties: molecular weight (g/mol e-), redox potential (V vs. Li/Li+), and active material concentration (mol actives/kg solvent). The molecular weight is defined as the molecular weight of redox active material normalized by the number of electrons transferred. The redox potential is defined as the average potential of electron transfer events that the material undergoes. The molecular weight and redox potential of a redox active molecule can be measured or simulated in less time and with more accuracy than active material solubility. Thus, the RFB Dashboard shows redox active materials on a two-dimensional materials-selection map, with axes of molecular weight and redox potential, while drawing concentration contours that achieves the target battery price. In the model each material is assumed to pair with a hypothetical counter-electrode material having a different potential than the material of interest, but common concentration and molecular weight. Using the RFB Dashboard \u00b6 Importing Data for Analysis \u00b6 Via Molecule Explorer \u00b6 Data can be imported into the tool via Molecule Explorer. By clicking on the \"via Molecule Explorer\" button on top of the RFB Dashboard, the Molecule Explorer would appear and materials with desired structures can be selected. Once a set of molecules is selected, click on the \"Explore Solubility\" button to import them into the RFB Dashboard for further analysis. For a visual tutorial on how to import data via Molecule Explorer, a short video is available to demonstrate how the Molecule Explorer is used. Via CSV \u00b6 Data can be imported into the tool via a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file. The CSV file should be formatted in such a way that there is a header for the first row of the data sheet and the order of the data columns does not matter. However, the header names for each column has to have 'formula' for molecular formula, 'mw' for molecular weight, 'redpot' for reduction potential and 'oxpot' for oxidation potential. Once your CSV file is ready, it can be uploaded into the tool by clicking on the \"via CSV\" button on top of the tool to upload the file, and the data will then be displayed on the tool. Description of Input Parameters \u00b6 Target Battery Price \u00b6 The Target Battery Price is the maximum battery price for RFBs built using the redox active materials enclosed by the concentration contours. The battery price is a combination of reactor cost, electrolyte cost, balance-of-plant and addition-to-price costs. Battery price neglects the cost of power-conditioning equipment that is included in system price defined in Ref. 1. As a result, when calculating battery price balance-of-plant costs are reduced by \\(100/kW compared to that in Ref. 1 used to calculate system price(\\) /kWh). Target Molality \u00b6 The Target Molality is the minimum concentration achieving the target battery price for redox active materials enclosed by the concentration contours. The molality is defined as a ratio of moles of redox active species to kilograms of solvent in mol/kg. Cost Parameters \u00b6 Reactor Cost Per Unit Area ($/m2) Salt Cost: cost per unit mass of supporting salt ($/kg) Solvent Cost: cost per unit mass of solvent ($/kg) Active Material Cost: cost per unit mass of active material ($/kg) Additional Contribution to Price: accounts for depreciation, labor, overhead, and margin ($/kW) Balance of Plant Cost: accounts for ancillary equipment costs ($/kW) Operating Conditions \u00b6 System Discharge Time: battery discharge time (hours) Depth of Discharge: allowable range of state-of-charge (-) Discharge Voltage Efficiency: ratio of cell potential during cycling to the thermodynamically reversible open-circuit cell potential (-) Round-trip Coulombic Efficiency: ratio of the charge released during the discharging step of a complete cycle relative to the charge stored during the charging step of a complete cycle. (-) Discharge System Efficiency: accounts for losses in energy during discharge due to auxiliary equipment. (-) Electrochemical Parameters \u00b6 Area-Specific Resistance: accounts for ohmic, kinetic, and mass-transfer resistance in the separator, electrodes, and electrolyte (\u03a9-cm2) Stability Limits (Nonaqueous only): solvent window of stability beyond which breakdown occurs (V vs. Li/Li+) Hypothetical Counter-Electrode Potential (Nonaqueous only): assumed hypothetical counter-electrode for full-cell analysis of single electrode materials. (V vs. Li/Li+) pH (Aqueous only): sets the pH of the aqueous solution. Aqueous stability limits are determined by the oxygen and hydrogen evolution potentials, which depend on the pH of the solution. The hypothetical counter-electrode potentials are selected in order to be within the stability limits within a margin of the \"Voltage Offset\" parameter. (-) Voltage Offset (Aqueous only): Hypothetical counter-electrodes, with which each molecule of interest is paired, are specified by an increment in voltage, called the Voltage Offset.

Indeed, while many materials properties can be computed nowadays with ab-initio computations. Those computed properties are only relevant if they are evaluated on a compound (i.e., a stoichiometry and crystal structure) stable enough to be formed. Crystal structure prediction can be quite useful for experimentalists too. For instance, when only powder XRD experiments are available after synthesis of a new compound, a theoretical suggestion of a likely structure can tremendously help the structure refinement and determination for example. The most common approach in the field of crystal structure prediction is to treat it as an optimization problem. 1 Researchers use optimization algorithms to search for the minimum of the relevant thermodynamic potential (e.g., the energy at 0 K, 0 atm) by varying the crystal's degrees of freedom (lattice constants, atomic positions). This optimization is extremely challenging as the energy landscape is very rugged and full of local minima. Very computationally expensive advanced optimization techniques (e.g., simulated annealing and genetic algorithm) are usually necessary to tackle this optimization problem. In a departure to this traditional approach, the methods we have developed use a combination of data mining and ab-initio computations in the density functional theory (DFT) framework to tackle this problem with a limited computational budget. The basic idea is to learn the chemical rules governing phase stability from a database of experimentally known compounds. Embedding those rules in a mathematical model, we can predict what are the most likely compounds to form in a given chemical system. Finally, the last step consists of testing those candidates for stability using ab-initio computations ( see Phase Diagram ). The Ionic Substitution based Structure Prediction Method \u00b6 The compound prediction model available on the Materials Project now, through the structure predictor app, is based on our recent work on the data mining of ionic substitutions. In this section we will briefly explain the idea of the approach and how to use the explorer. More details can be found in Hautier et al. 2 The basic idea \u00b6 Figure 1: An example of ionic substitution. It is common for chemists to propose new compounds from the substitution of another, chemically similar, ion. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 1, knowing that BaTiO 3 forms a perovskite structure, one can deduct that it is likely for another chemically similar ion as Ca 2+ to form the same structure. We have implemented a mathematical model that learns these substitution rules from a database of experimentally observed crystal structure (e.g., the ICSD). Basically, what the model provides is a probability distribution for any ionic substitution. In Figure 2 we show the matrix indicating the data mined substitution tendency for two ionic species obtained from this work. The ions have been sorted by Mendeleev number and therefore groups of chemically similar ions (e.g., the transition metals) are grouped together. Red colors indicate that two ions tend to substitute while blue is associated with pair of species not substituting to each other. Figure 2: Data mined tendency for ionic substitutions. Red indicates high substitution tendency. Blue indicates that the tow ions tend to not substitute. The compound prediction procedure \u00b6 The product of our data mining approach is a probability function indicating how likely is a specific set of ionic substitutions. The model we used was inspired by previous work in the field of machine translation. In this field, it is the probability for a word in one language to be able to be substituted by a word in another language. In our case, we substitute ions rather than words. After we built this probability function, from a database of experimental data (here the ICSD), we can perform compound predictions. Figure 3 illustrates the procedure for 4 ions (but this can be generalized to any number of species). Targeting a specific combination of 4 ions (e.g., Ba 2+ , Fe 3+ , La 3+ , O 2- ), we look for any substitution from known compounds (in the ICSD) that have a high enough probability to be likely to form a new stable compound. If the substitution is higher than a certain threshold we keep it as a possible candidate, otherwise we discard it and go to the next ICSD compound. There is also a check to make sure we do not form duplicate structures and only predict charge balanced compounds. Figure 3: Procedure for proposing new compound candidates in a quaternary system using the ionic substitution probability. From this procedure, we can see that the threshold set is quite important. A higher threshold will give you less false positives (suggested compounds that are not stable), but also less true positives. On the other hand, too low a threshold will give more true positives, but consequently, more false positives. There is a compromise to find between how exhaustive you want to be and how many candidates you can have, in terms of computational budget (that you will have to test down the road for stability using DFT). Performance and Limitations \u00b6 Using the Structure Predictor \u00b6 Entering Inputs \u00b6 Practically, the procedure for getting predictions consists in 3 steps Pick elements: Select on the periodic table what constituent elements comprise the chemical space you are interested in. For instance if you want to make predictions for battery materials based on Li, Mn and O, you should pick those three elements. Pick oxidation states: The model uses the oxidation states to make predictions. V 3+ does not substitute with the same elements as V 5+ , so if you want to study Mn 3+ compounds, you should pick +3 for Mn, +1 for Li (no other choices anyway) and -2 for O. Sometimes you do not know what oxidation states you are interest in. Let say you want all Li-Mn-O compounds regardless of the oxidation state of Mn. Then, I would suggest running the model several times, one for Mn 2+ , one for Mn 3+ , and lastly one for Mn 4+ . This should cover all the chemical space you are looking at. Start the prediction: click 'Predict Structure' to begin the prediction. Predictions are not immediately available and will require some time to complete. You can monitor the status of your request in the dashboard . Examine results: Upon completion of the task, you will be given a link to a landing page providing details on the candidate structures. We also provide cif files for the predicted compounds as well as VASP files ready to be run with standard parameters. We do not provide any DFT results due our limited computational budget for the moment. It is the responsibility of the user to run the predictions. Also, as the pseudopotentials are proprietary in VASP (POTCARs) we do not provide those but a script is sent along that can be run to make sure the POTCARs are built from a directory containing all pseudopotentials. Interpreting the Results \u00b6 The results pages provides a set of structure id's corresponding to the candidate structures. A link is provided for each structure id, which provides structure visualization, lattice vectors, atomic positions, and simulated x-ray spectra. Cif and POSCAR files for each candidate can be downloaded. Typically, the candidates need to be tested for stability against each other (seeing what is the lowest energy structure amongst the candidates at a given composition) but also against other phases known in nature. For instance, if a AB compound is proposed and its energy is higher than a combination of half A 2 B and half AB 2 . This stability analysis can be performed using the convex hull construction that will effectively test the stability of the phases against each other and come with a set of stable phases that are on the hull. Figure 4 shows a convex hull (in green) for an A-B system. Blue points indicate phases that are not on the hull and therefore unstable and red points indicate stable phases. For instance, the construction shows directly that the phase \u03b3 at AB will decompose into \u03b1 1 and \u03b2 2 . Figure 4: An example of the convex hull construction. More information about phase stability and convex hull can be obtained in the phase diagram app manual . Please note that we only presented an approach for building zero K, zero pressure phase diagrams. It is possible to use the candidates proposed by the model to perform more advanced stability studies for instance at finite temperature. This is more expensive computationally though as the different entropy components (configuration, vibration, etc...) need to be taken into account. Finally, as we present a usage of our candidates for computations, an experimentalist can also use these candidates to test different structures versus a powder diffraction pattern. Future features \u00b6 In the future, we want to give the user the option to perform substitution of several ions for one ion in a starting structure. For instance, if one is interested in ternary oxychlorides (M, O 2- , Cl 1- ) there will be only few ternary compounds that will be good candidates for a substitution generating oxychlorides (e.g., oxybromides). A strategy to increase the pool of possible structure is to allow substitution of one ion by O 2- and Cl - . For instance, we would start with an oxide and substitute the O 2- by a mixture of O 2- and Cl - . The amount of O and Cl will be set to achieve charge balance and a simple model (electrostatics or other) could be used to pick an ordering of the two substituted species. The only data mined model accessible now is the substitution predictor. We have developed another model based on correlations between crystal structures at different compositions. 3 4 We plan to give access to this model in the future. The two models are complimentary: the model based on correlations between structure is more efficient in data rich regions (e.g., ternary oxides) while the ionic substitution model is more efficient in data sparse regions (e.g., quaternaries).

Evaluate each coordination pattern via coordination descriptors observed at each site to define site fingerprints. Compute statistics of the descriptor values across all sites in a structure to define structure fingerprints. Use structure fingerprints to rate the (dis)similarity between the two (vectors representing the two) structures. Near-neighbor finding \u00b6 We use a novel method called CrystallNN to find near(est) neighbors in periodic structures. While the method will be introduced shortly 3 , it is already available through the python package pymatgen . Site Fingerprints \u00b6 The second step of the structure similarity calculation is the computation of a crystal site fingerprint, \\(v^{site}\\) , for each site in the two structures. The fingerprint is a 61-dimensional vector in which each element carries information about the local coordination environment computed with the site module of the python package matminer . For example, the first two elements \"wt \\(\\ce{CN1}\\) \" and \"single bond \\(\\ce{CN1}\\) \" provide estimates of the likelihood (or weight) of how much the given site should be considered 1-fold coordinated (i.e., w \\(|_{CN=1}\\) ).
