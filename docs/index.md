- Foundation: concepts in materials and computer science we use to structure
  and interpret our data sets
- Methodology: how we generate and validate our computed data sets
- User Guide: materials analysis and design using our data and tools
- User Reference: Detailed help for using our website,
  application programming interface (API), and codebases.
- Contribution: Developer guides and design specifications

If you notice an error or omission, please post an [issue](https://github.com/materialsproject/docs/issues/new) or click a pencil icon
(<span class="md-icon" style="color:grey">edit</span>) on a page to suggest an
edit to us.

Thanks,
Materials Project Team
