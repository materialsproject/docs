# Dielectric Calculations

## Introduction

A dielectric is a material that can be polarized by an applied electric
field. This limits the dielectric effect to materials with a non-zero
band gap. The mathematical description of the dielectric effect is a
tensor constant of proportionality that relates an externally applied
electric field to the field within the material. Along with the
elastic and piezoelectric tensors, the dielectric tensor provides all
the information necessary for the solution of the constitutive equations
in applications where electric and mechanical stresses are coupled.

The dielectric tensors from the Materials Project (MP) are calculated
from first principles Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) [^1]
and are approximated as the superimposed effect of an electronic and
ionic contribution. From the full piezoelectric tensor, several
properties are derived such as the refractive index and potential for
ferroelectricity. Just as with the piezoelectric and elastic constants,
multiple consistency checks are performed on all the calculated
dielectric data to ensure its reliability and accuracy.

## Formalism

Formally, the dielectric tensor ε relates the externally applied
electric field to the field within the material and can be defined as:

$$
E_i=\sum_j \epsilon^{-1}_{ij}E_{0j}
$$

where $E$ is the electric
field inside the material and $E_0$ is the externally applied
electric field. the indices *i*,*j* refer to the direction in space and
take the values: ${1, 2, 3}$. The dielectric tensor can be split in
the ionic ($\epsilon_0$) and electronic ($\epsilon*\infty$)
contributions:

$$
\epsilon_{ij}=\epsilon_{ij}^0+\epsilon_{ij}^\infty
$$

Here, we consider only the response of non-zero band gap materials to
time-invariant fields. In the hypothetical case that a material does not
respond at all to the external field, $\epsilon_{ij}^\infty$ would
be equal to the identity tensor and  $\epsilon_{ij}^0$ would be
zero. In fact, materials with zero ionic contribution do exist. In
general, for $\epsilon_{ij}^0$ to be non-zero, compounds need to
have at least 2 atoms per primitive cell, each having a different atomic
charge. The dielectric tensor is symmetric and respects all the symmetry
operations of the corresponding point group. This limits the number of
independent elements in the tensor to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6
depending on the crystal symmetry.

The dielectric response calculated herein corresponds to that of a
single crystal. In polycrystalline samples, grains are oriented randomly
and hence, the actual response will be different. Generally, the
dielectric response varies with the frequency of the applied external
field however here, we consider the static response (i.e., the response
at constant electric fields or the long wavelength limit). Since the
ionic contribution vanishes at high frequencies, our results can be used
to obtain an estimate of the refractive index, n, at optical frequencies
and far from resonance effects using the well known formula[^2]:

$$
n=\sqrt{\epsilon^\infty_{poly}}
$$

where $\epsilon^\infty_{poly}$ is the average of the eigenvalues of
the electronic contribution to the dielectric tensor. It should be noted
this equation for the refractive index assumes the material is
non-magnetic.

## DFT Parameters

The initial set of 1,056 dielectric tensors were calculated using the
Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package[^3][^4][^5][^6] (VASP version 5.3.4)
combined with the Generalized Gradient Approximation
GGA/PBE[^7][^8]+U[^9][^10] exchange-correlation functional and Projector
Augmented Wave pseudopotentials[^11][^12]. The U values are energy
corrections that address the spurious self-interaction energy introduced
by GGA. Here, we used U values for d orbitals only that were fitted to
experimental binary formation enthalpies using Wang et al.[^13] method.
The full list of U values used, can be found in ref.[^10]. The k-point
density was set at 3,000 per reciprocal atom and the plane wave energy
cut-off at 600 eV (ref. 4). For detailed information on the calculation
of the dielectric tensor within the DFPT framework we refer to Baroni et
al.[^14][^15] and Gonze & Lee[^16].

[Piezoelectricity calculations](/methodology/piezoelectricity) use the same
DFPT methodology with a tighter parameter set to achieve convergence. As
a result, the dielectric tensor is already converged in these
calculations and is reported for any non-centrosymmetric material, not
in the initial dataset of dielectrics.

## Benchmarking

We see that in most cases, it is possible to predict the dielectric
constant of materials with a relative deviation of less than +/−25% from
experimental values at room temperature. Including local field effects
gives the smallest mean absolute relative deviation ( MARD= 16.2 % for
GGA). Furthermore, we note a tendency to overestimate rather than
underestimate the dielectric constant relative to experiments, which is
a well-known effect of DFPT [^17][^18][^19] for the electronic
contribution. Although it has often been related to the band gap
underestimation problem of DFT, DFPT is a ground state theory and hence,
the dielectric constant should, in principle, be described exactly
[^20]. In fact, as described by various authors, the problem is likely
linked to the exchange-correlation functional
[^21][^22][^23][^24][^25][^26]. Specifically, the exchange correlation
functional has been found to depend on polarization but the actual
dependence formula is, unfortunately, not known [^27][^28][^29].
Additionally, the validity of GGA depends on the charge density varying
slowly—an assumption that may be broken when an external electric field
is applied [^30].
