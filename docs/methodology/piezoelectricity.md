# Piezoelectricity Calculations

## Introduction

Piezoelectricity is a reversible physical process that occurs in some
materials whereby an electric moment is generated upon the application
of a stress. This is often referred to as the direct piezoelectric
effect. Conversely, the indirect piezoelectric effect refers to the case
when a strain is generated in a material upon the application of an
electric field. The mathematical description of piezoelectricity relates
the strain (or stress) to the electric field via a third order tensor.
This tensor describes the response of any piezoelectric bulk material,
when subjected to an electric field or a mechanical load.

The piezoelectric constants from the Materials Project (MP) are
calculated from first principles Density Functional Perturbation Theory
(DFPT) [^1] and are approximated as the superimposed effect of an
electronic and ionic contribution. From the full piezoelectric tensor,
several properties are derived such as the maximum longitudinal
piezoelectric modulus and the corresponding crystallographic direction.
Just as with the elastic constants, multiple consistency checks are
performed on all the calculated piezoelectric data to ensure its
reliability and accuracy.

## Formalism

In this work, we calculate the piezoelectric stress coefficients,
$\textstyle e_{ijk}^{T}$ from DFPT, with units of
$\textstyle C/m^{2}$. These can be defined in terms of thermodynamic
derivatives as shown below [^2].

$$
e_{ijk}^{T}= \left(\frac{\partial D_{i}}{\partial \varepsilon_{jk}}\right)_{E, T} = -\left(\frac{\partial \sigma_{jk}}{\partial E_{i}}\right)_{\varepsilon, T} \!
$$

where $\textstyle D$, $\textstyle E$,
$\textstyle \varepsilon$, $\textstyle \sigma$ and
$\textstyle T$ represent the electric displacement field, the
electric field, the strain tensor, the stress tensor and the
temperature, respectively.

The above relations can be written in Voigt-notation as shown below.

$$
e_{ij}^{T}= \left(\frac{\partial D_{i}}{\partial \varepsilon_{j}}\right)_{E, T} = -\left(\frac{\partial \sigma_{j}}{\partial E_{i}}\right)_{\varepsilon, T} \!
$$

We note that the most commonly used piezoelectric constants appearing in
the (experimental) literature are the piezoelectric strain constants,
usually denoted by $\textstyle d_{ijk}$. These can be readily
related to the constants $\textstyle e_{ijk}$ if the elastic
compliances $\textstyle s_{lmjk}^{T}$ (at constant electric field
and temperature) of the materials are known:
$\textstyle d_{ijk}^{T} = e_{ilm} s_{lmjk}^{ET}$. In particular, the
piezoelectric strain constants can be expressed thermodynamically as
shown below

$$
d_{kij}^{T} = \left(\frac{\partial \varepsilon_{ij}}{\partial E_{k}}\right)_{\sigma, T} = \left(\frac{\partial D_{k}}{\partial \sigma_{ij}}\right)_{E, T} \!
$$

It is well-known that the piezoelectric behavior can only occur in
crystals that lack inversion symmetry. This is the direct consequence of
the symmetry properties of the piezoelectric tensor, which is of order 3. Another fundamental requirement for piezoelectric behavior is that
the material has a band gap. Combined, these criteria severely limit the
amount of compounds in nature that have the potential to exhibit
piezoelectric behavior.

For the Materials Project in particular, potential piezoelectric
materials in the database are identified by i) allowing only structures
with space groups 1, 3-9, 16-46, 75-82, 89-122, 143-146, 149-161,
168-174, 177-190, 195-199, 207-220 (since these space groups lack
inversion symmetry), and in addition ii) the calculated DFT bandgap of
the material &gt; 0.1 eV. Compounds in the Materials Project database
that satisfy these criteria are selected for a full-DFT calculation of
the piezoelectric tensor and derived properties (see below).

## Derived piezoelectric properties

For elastic properties, which are based on a tensor of order 4,
isotropic Voigt and Reuss averages can be derived on the bulk and shear
moduli. For piezoelectric properties, this isotropic averaging-approach
does not quite work due to the requirement that inversion symmetry
cannot occur in piezoelectric materials. On MP, in addition to the
piezoelectric tensor in Voigt-notation, we report the maximum
longitudinal piezoelectric modulus of the compound and the corresponding
crystallographic direction in which this occurs. One can think of these
quantities as the piezoelectric counterpart of the well-known Young's
modulus and the stiffest elastic direction in the context of
elasticity-theory. Fig. 1 shows an example of how the longitudinal
piezoelectric modulus can be represented in 3D. This is for the case of
a cubic material. As can be seen clearly, the maximum modulus occurs in
the &lt;111&gt; family of crystallographic directions. By symmetry, this
is always the case for cubic piezoelectric materials. Fig. 2 shows a
more complicated longitudinal piezoelectric modulus-surface for an
orthorhombic compound. In that case, the relative magnitudes of the
tensor components dictate in which crystallographic direction, the
maximum response occurs. Finally, note that for some compounds, a
piezoelectric response is only induced by shear deformation rather than
tensile or compressive deformation. For these cases, the response cannot
be depicted such as in Figs. 1 and 2. The representations such as in
Figs. 1 and 2 and created using the open-source MTEX package [^3][^4][^5].

## DFT parameters

The first-principles results presented in this work are performed using
the projector augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in the Vienna
Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP). In all calculations, we employ the
Perdew, Becke and Ernzerhof (PBE) Generalized Gradient Approximation
(GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. A cut-off for the plane
waves of 1000 eV is used and a uniform k-point density of approximately
2,000 per reciprocal atom (pra) is employed, which means that the number
of atoms per cell multiplied by the number of k-points equals
approximately 2,000. For the compounds that contain magnetic elements, a
ferromagnetic state is initialized in the calculation. Similarly to our
previous work, we expect to correctly converge to ferromagnetic and
non-magnetic states in this way, but not to anti-ferromagnetic states.
Due to the presence of strongly correlated electrons in some of the
oxides, the GGA+U method is employed, with U representing the
Hubbard-parameter. The values of U are chosen consistent with those
employed in MP.

up according to the crystal system and the different point group

## Crystal symmetry

The crystal symmetry and in particular the point group dictates the
symmetry of the piezoelectric tensor, relates components of the tensor
to each other and imposes that certain components equal zero. All
piezoelectric tensors in the Materials Project have been symmetrized for
consistency with the underlying point group of the compound. Figure 4
gives an overview of the symmetrized piezoelectric tensors in MP, broken
up by the different piezoelectric point groups. Also, typical surface
representations are shown. The point group that only yields
piezoelectric behavior upon the application of shear is not included in
the representation in Fig. 4.

longitudinal piezoelectric modulus in 3D are also shown for each crystal
point group. Note that depending on the components of the piezoelectric
tensor, the surface representation can differ from those shown here. See
