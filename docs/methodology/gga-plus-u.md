# GGA+U Calculations

It is well-known that first principles calculations within the local
density approximation (LDA) or generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
lead to considerable error in calculated redox reaction energies of many
transition metal compounds. This error arises from the self-interaction
error in LDA and GGA, which is not canceled out in redox reactions where
an electron is transferred between significantly different environments,
such as between a metal and a transition metal or between a transition
metal and oxygen or fluorine. Extensive discussion of this issue can be found in the
following works.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

In the Materials Project, we have calibrated U values for many
transition metals of interest using the approach outlined in Wang et
al.'s work[^5]. At the present moment, U values have only been calibrated for
transition metal oxide systems. U values were calibrated for the following
elements: Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, V and W. The choice of systems to which we
apply U was largely determined by our experience and by systematic
benchmarking. It is very likely that we will expand calibration of U
values to more chemical systems in the future.

In the Materials Project, for an oxide or fluoride material with a transition
element listed previously, with the VASP input settings constructed according to
the logic defined in [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/blob/master/pymatgen/io/vasp/MPRelaxSet.yaml).

Note that for fluorides, the U value gets set to the one calibrated from the oxide system, although
in principle our architecture allows different U values to be set for oxides and fluorides respectively.

## Calibration of U values

The U values were obtained by fitting to experimental binary formation
enthalpies as described in Wang et al.'s work. This method is simple yet
accurately reproduces phase stabilities. A least squares method of
obtaining the correct U value was used, as follows:

1.  For each non-overlapping formation energy reaction considered, we
    find the region where the formation energy error passes zero. For
    the V-O system, this includes the following:
    - $\ce{2 V2O3 + O2 -> 4 VO2}$
    - $\ce{4 VO2 + O2 -> 2 V2O5}$
2.  For each formation energy region identified, we fit the linear
    equation $\begin{align} \mbox{Error/redox} & = m U + c \end{align}$ to
    the final U range. In the case of V, we will have two sets of (m,c).
3.  We find the U value that minimizes the sum of square Error / Redox.
4.  In the case of V, we get a U value of 3.25.

## U values

The full list of U values used is described in the table below. For
oxides and fluorides containing any of the elements, only GGA+U calculations
are performed.

## Caveats

The U values are calibrated for phase stability analyses, and should be
used with care if applied to obtain other properties such as band
structures. Also, the U values depend on the pseudopotential used. Further,
typically, U values should be site specific, however in our approach, U values were
applied to all sites with an element listed above, and only to the d-orbitals. A discussion of the
pseudopotentials used in the Materials Project can be
found [here](/methodology/pseudopotentials).
